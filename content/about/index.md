title: About me
---

Hey there, welcome to my cyber-castle where all that I do is collated
and referenced.  

I'm a man of many muses and the polylemma of choosing one at a moment
in time is a luxury I'm glad I can afford.  

I contemplate quite a lot and I find writing to be a good exercise towards
recording evolution of the self over my life.  

Eventhough the right thing to say would be "I enjoy a good debate",
all I really thrive on are lively intellectual brawls, to the extent that I have a
tad too many intellectual frenemies and enefriends alike.  

All the opinions stated herein are my own and albeit my meandering casualness,
do expect a liberal pinch of seriousness occasionally thrown into this
epistemological potpourri that livens up this cyber-castle.
