title: About me

Hi, This is Raj: 

I like maintaining an evolution of my thought process over time and am
an arguably extensive dabbler, while trying to master
specific domains of course. I believe different knowledge domains are
more intertwined than we acknowledge them to be and I find it
interesting to build connections. I'm re-writing this on #2110 and can
already feel the difference in how I think since the last time I
blogged #2000 : this is what this repository of articles tries to
encapsulate - given time, how different one can end up in terms of all
the aspects of their life.  

Albeit a hobby at which I don't particularly excel, writing has been something (since I
was 19 (19-22 content archived and not posted here)that
helps me document my mind and better represent my online presence than
any other social media would allow me to.
