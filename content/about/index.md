Hi, This is Raj:  

I like maintaining an evolution of my thought process over time and am
an arguably extensive dabbler, while trying to master
specific domains of course. I believe different knowledge domains are
more intertwined than we acknowledge them to be and I find it
interesting to build connections.  

Albeit a hobby at which I don't particularly excel, writing has been (since I was 19) helping me document my mind and better represent my online presence than
any other social media would allow me to.
