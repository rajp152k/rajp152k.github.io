### EDIT : 0x22D2 : Fri Sep 27 03:51:30 PM IST 2024

 - I'm thinking I'll proceed in common lisp
 - do read on for amusement though

As of 0x22CE (Mon Sep 23 06:48:40 AM IST 2024), These are the operating systems I've used:
 - Open Suse TumbleWeed
 - Fedora, CentOs, Rocky
 - Debian, Ubuntu, Kali
 - Arch
 - Windows XP,Vista,7,10,11

I recently moved away from Fedora 40 to Tumbleweed (I deleted some core python libraries that are essential for yum and dnf (I know, I'm an idiot))...  

TumbleWeed has btrfs snapshots enabled by default and that convinced me to jump ship.  

For a while before I settled on tumbleweed, I was in the distrohopper's psychic polylemma again (it's quite the mood).  

Now I know, underneath, it's all the same (abstractions over your processor's instruction set), but I'm somewhat of an abstract personality and do enjoy fretting over intellectual mirages.  


So today morning (around 6 AM), for the hack value, I just thought of pairing together two  antithetic technologies and writing my own operating system.  

I've had some good days (and nights) with [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), so I thought I'd go with it.  

Do note that It's going to be like driving in a foggy eternity for a while and I'll have to backtrack from time to time..  

But, along the way, I expect learning consiberably about sub-domains that I did not know existed.  

From setting up a development environment to figuring out what all I'm going to have to figure out, I hope to have a descent amount of fun while I'm at it..  

I'm expecting this to be a stretched out hobby project, and am quite enthusiastic about the epistemological mine-fields that I'm headed towards.  

Do checkout https://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_Started  

I will document the musings, thoughts, hallucinations and eurekas over on this blog and youtube as a series..  

BTW, if the reason for me getting into this isn't clear, it's more along the lines of, "Hmm, that would be cool ..."
