This video is the second part (0x1) of a series on writing an operating system. The creator, Raj, details the comprehensive studying and logging strategy he has designed to tackle this long-term project. The goal is to create a structured approach that fosters deep understanding, maintains motivation, and effectively manages the vast scope of the endeavor.

### Introduction and Motivation

*   [00:00:10] Raj introduces the topic: the "studying and logging strat" for his OS project, emphasizing the need for proper preparation and a "generic compass" for a long journey.
*   [00:03:00] He frames writing an OS as a problem that requires true understanding, unlike tasks that can be "handwaved" with AI. This project serves as a personal answer to the question of how to genuinely study complex topics today.
*   [00:05:00] The project is approached as a fun, challenging hobby, with the goal of building a formal, well-documented effort to avoid fizzling out.

### Core Logging and Study Strategy

*   [00:07:30] **Daily Journaling:** Raj uses `org-journal` in Emacs to log his daily thoughts, questions, and what he's learning. He dedicates approximately 15 hours per week to the project.
*   [00:09:40] **"Meditations" Log:** A separate, long-term log is used to capture larger, open-ended questions about systems design, research, and learning strategies. This allows complex ideas to "simmer" over time.
*   [00:15:30] **Fundamental Learning:** His primary learning resource is the textbook ***Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)***. He is working through it systematically.
*   [00:17:50] **Hands-on C Practice:** To rebuild his C programming skills, he is actively coding the examples from OSTEP, tinkering with the source code, and pushing it to a Git repository.
*   [00:20:45] **Starting with C:** He explains his decision to start with C is to first deeply understand *why* it is the standard for OS development (e.g., POSIX, memory control, hardware interaction) before he can logically consider alternatives.

### Advanced Learning with Emacs and AI

*   [00:26:00] **Knowledge Graph with Org-roam:** He uses **Org-roam** not as a static knowledge base, but as a "wisdom generator" to build and visualize connections between concepts. He demonstrates a workflow where he makes his Emacs window transparent to view his knowledge graph in the background.
*   [00:27:50] **AI-Generated Outlines:** Using the **`gptel`** package in Emacs, he sends topics to an LLM to generate concise, jargon-heavy outlines. This helps him quickly identify key areas and create links to other nodes in his knowledge graph.
*   [00:30:15] **AI as an Expert Mentor:** He uses another tool, **`aidermacs`**, with a custom "Unix graybeard" persona. This enables a conversational Q&A format for exploring deep systems programming questions, which has helped him "rediscover" concepts like *tickless kernels*.

### Tooling and Resources

*   [00:12:40] **Virtualization:** He plans to use KVM and Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) to automate his testing pipeline.
*   [00:36:20] **Emacs as the Hub:** Emacs is the central tool for his entire workflowâ€”managing journals, reading PDFs, writing code, interacting with LLMs, and accessing `man` pages.
*   [00:39:50] **Supplemental Books:** He intends to read other books like *Modern C* and *Hacking: The Art of Exploitation* to broaden his knowledge in related areas like security.

### Conclusion

*   [00:41:00] Raj concludes that even after a short time, this structured approach has already produced a positive mindset shift and increased his feelings of competence.
*   [00:41:40] He assures his audience, many of whom are Emacs users, that Emacs will remain central to the series, serving as a powerful tool that becomes an "extension of your body" in the "war" of building an OS.
