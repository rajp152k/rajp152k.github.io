I'd managed to produce some fairly original essays on my last blog and
I'll soon be incorporating them into posts here. I had a habit of
writing in streams in the main blog itself and there is a lot of
insight stored in the chronology of some such logs.  

The old blog is archived in the repository
[here](https://github.com/rajp152k/19-22_archive) and I could benefit
from repurposing old works into the present setup.  

I'll mainly be focusing on editing the fluff out, finding what good
stylistic knacks I've accumulated over the years, and rejecting the
questionable habits that don't serve me so well.  

This will also aid me in developing the much needed habit of intently analysing
and editing past works. That is one source of deliberate practice that
I could definitely use after this long a break (10 months).
