# 0x1FFD

I understand that society created the construct of time to facilitate
collaboration and create accountable systems.  

But...,  
it can be easy to lose a sense of your personal time as you continue
working towards a particular goal. I do not like the idea of relying
on alarms and calendars all the time to keep track of my progress all
that I choose to pursue.  

So...,  
I'm continuing a practice that I practiced for a short while during
the last summer. It helped me keep track of time with a more personal
touch and reminds me to decouple myself from what's going on with the
world calendar in the moment.  

I'll be maintaining a mental hex counter for the number of days I've
been alive - without, hopefully, calculating it each day.  

It helps me be more aware of how I'm spending the day and also gives
me a implicit long term progress tracker.  

Logging the specifics with some more detail:  

## The Gregorian Calendar is non-uniform

 - I don't like exceptions.
 - There's just too many in what we use these days.
 
## Hex over Decimal cause...

 - In case I forget the counter, I'll be doing the conversion on paper  
   - no functions  
   - It makes forgetting a more penalizing activity.  
 - Humans can always naturally count in bits (morse is universal) but if we lose a
   couple of digits some day, decimal is not so convenient anymore.  
 - Hex makes intrigues more humans: it's a good conversation starter.  
 
## Time dilation

 - Just counting the days I've been alive made the months go much
   slower (only perceptually of course)  
 - helps me not turn into a zombie and keep track of my long term
   goals  
 
 
## Being more aware of ranges

 - dedicating 64 days towards an objective allows me divide my work
   smartly compared to saying I've 2 months for something.  
 - It's a semiotics thing: a "month" is not something I personally
   relate to when recording progress but "days" helps me imagine what
   each one of those days in different phases of that duration might
   need to look like to not just dream about doing stuff and actually
   make practical plans.  
 - I'll be timestamping my blogs henceforth here as well (it's a
   practice I began from my [second blog](https://rajpatil.dev/19-22_archive)) 
   and in the long run, it'll help me better gauge what I've achieved
   in the past.  
   - again it's a semiotics thing for me : I'll choose 256 days rather
     than 1 year to check my growth: my brain just activates
     different pathways even though they're periods of similar
     scales: seeing zeros on the hex counter feels cool.  
	 
## It's Personal

 - The earth's been there for I don't know how long(exactly).  
 - I'm a philosophical lad : we think about the endings and origins
   of things pretty frequently.  
 - a personal counter helps me stay practical and not lose track of
   the present when I'm being a tad bit delusional.  
 - I also happen to be just in time to reinitialize this oddity to
   experience 0x2000 in an aware manner.
