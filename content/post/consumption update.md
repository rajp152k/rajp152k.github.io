Two days ago I found myself scrolling mindlessly for half an hour and
I decided I need to decide for real as to how I'm going to deal with
this issue.  

The problem with such a habit is that it is very convenient, engaging
and it slices into precious time that I'd rather spend doing something
more difficult and rewarding like reading.  

While devising a strategy to deal with this behaviour, I concluded
that videos themselves (long and short form) are the culprit to these
new time sinks that I've been experiencing.  

Another neural bait that cyber/social attention engineers employ to
capture my attention is the use of vivid colours and forcing
unnecessary notifications in places where I'd simply prefer getting
in, completing a specific task and getting out. For this very reason, I hate youtube and instagram for integrating shorts into the main application and not
allowing a way to disable them.  

Given I plan to create content based on my interests, I cannot do away
with these platforms completely.  

A few decisions I've taken for damage control given the inevitability
of the need to be on such platforms for content creators are as
follows:
 - Limit usage to specific times of the day and only if I want to post
   something, never to consume content 
 - I listen to most of my podcasts on spotify and fallback to youtube
   only in cases I needed something more peculiar  
 - always read up first before I watch a video describing the same :
   always prefer text - It's faster and more precise for me.  
   - the alternative is just me being lazy and I'd rather relax than 
     watch something of importance lazily. 
 - Using my phone in grayscale mode at all times : this is a 
   life-saver, my eyes have never felt so well rested (It's been more 
   than a week now). 
 - building a habit of reading on my phone rather than scrolling :
   this is a relatively more demanding ask and has to be dealt with 
   strategically.. 
   - I maintain around half a dozen active reads (all ebooks) at a 
     time so that I can read according to my whims and am not stuck to 
     a specific kind of content at all times of the day. 
 - Be patient, and meditate mathematically and philosophically, 
   on my environment, playing my own mental games.  
 - Not pulling out the phone during the smallest of breaks is another 
   useful habit.  
 - If I do have to consume a long form video, I'll add it to watch 
   laters and only listen to the audio during walks or commutes. 
   - If it is important, written sources will always exist and should 
     be preferred over videos. 
 - Limit instagram usage to my desktop; again only to post content 
   regarding my content creation pursuits.  
   - All the important people in my life have my cell number
     accessible. 
 - being okay with being bored - This is a superpower.
 
Consuming mostly text throughout my day does help with not
overstimulating my mind.
