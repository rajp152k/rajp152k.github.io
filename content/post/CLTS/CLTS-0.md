This is the first in a series of blog posts that follow the educational common lisp series on my [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@rajp152k) as an
auxilliary.

I'll be summarizing the videos in these blogs and be using these to
point to references and additional resources that further elaborate
the matter.  

This post is about why you should consider learning common lisp and
how I intend to execute the plan of building an end to end resource
index while simultaneously being able to learn more about the language
myself.  

## Prerequisites 

I'll be covering the basics while not boring seasoned professionals
who might be trying out common lisp for the first time. Therefore the
only prerequisites are:
 - enthusiasm for beginners
 - a little patience on behalf of the experts before we get onto the
   advanced topics

## References

As for the the rest of the details, the video briefly discusses what
your editor should be able to do for a comfortable experience with
lisp. More information on how you can proceed can be picked up from
this [roadmap to common lisp](https://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/#s11-pick-an-editor)
by Steve Losh.   

If you really wish to get started right and would not
like to defer the hurdle that emacs is (it is worth it though), you
may refer [this playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ)
on getting started with emacs from scratch by SystemCrafters.  

Once you are comfortable with your editor (remember shortcuts and can
philosophically defend your choice), you can move on to setting up
your lisp development environment. If you choose emacs, you may
proceed with 
[slime](https://slime.common-lisp.dev/) or
[sly](http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/#A-SLY-tour-for-SLIME-users).  

Now that you're all setup and ready to greet the world, you may want
some inspiration for getting into common lisp and
there's no place better than the [essays of Paul
Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html) for that.  

## We're ready ...

Before we meet again in the next video,
do note that I publish on this main blog and on youtube after my plans and
content in the [buffer](https://buffer.rajpatil.dev) mature. A quick
search in the index should indicate what I've been up to and where I'm
headed.  

## Call to collaborate

If you're someone who shares the dream of making lisp popular and
mainstream so that we can use it for our jobs and don't have to switch
to blubs to make a living (without denting its charm of course) ,
consider contributing to the notes and hit me up via mail or any of
the other media I'm present on.  

Wish you a serendipitous and sexpy future with lisp.
