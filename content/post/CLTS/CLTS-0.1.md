What makes lisp so unique is the way its code is structured - you
definitely can't miss all those parentheses. In this section of the
series, I discuss the cause for such a representation and how that
makes lisp unique in terms of how it views its code as data as code (aka homo-iconicity).

## Call to collaborate

If you're someone who shares the dream of making lisp popular and
mainstream so that we can use it for our jobs and don't have to switch
to blubs to make a living (without denting its charm of course) ,
consider contributing to the notes and hit me up via mail or any of
the other media I'm present on.  

Wish you a serendipitous and sexpy future with lisp.
