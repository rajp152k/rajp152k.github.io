I finished my first pass of SICP (structure and interpretation of
computer programs) around [3 years
ago](https://github.com/rajp152k/SICP). Since, I've realized the
elegantly implicit existence of symbolic algebra in several domains
that I personally explore on a regular basis.  

That initial infatuation with Lisp ( and consequently symbolic
computation ) has simmered and fermented enough in my mind to be
realised as a potent generic thinking device. To cement my
commitment to the same, I'll regularly dive deeper into relevant academia
so I don't lose out on the joys of thinking for the sake of itself.  

The first such rigorous choice after a period of seeking practicality
when it comes to lisp is [Adventures in Advanced Symbolic Programming
(MIT OCW
6.945)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-945-adventures-in-advanced-symbolic-programming-spring-2009/)  

I'll be updating my progress in a reverse chronological stream, along
with temporally independent note nodes in the ideation buffer at [this
specific node](https://buffer.thebitmage.com/%2F20240410114903-mit_ocw_6_945_aiasp.html)
