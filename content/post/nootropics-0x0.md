This is a brief update on the
[nootropics](https://thebitmage.com/post/nootropics-init/) post in which
I initialized my current stack and promised for a review down the
lane.  


I'm back on a controlled dosage of caffeine - 80 mg (dawn) + 80 mg
(afternoon). Each cup is supplmented with 100 mg of L-theanine and
also dump in 5+ grams of creatine in the dawn. Both do their job well
and will continue them this cycle.  

From the last phase, I'm most indifferent to L-tyrosine and dropping
out of that this cycle. The melatonin did their job well but will
cycle in magnesium instead this time. That, along with ashwagandha will
form the backbone of my sleep stack.  

From a physical perspective, jumping rope for 45 mins thrice a week,
along with an hour long barefoot rush up a small hill - both in golden
early mornings. That is descent sunlight exposure. Do cycle around
(have a fat bike) on weekends sometime. Resistance training 6 times a
week for an hour at dawn. This, I feel, is necessary for I like to
actively engage with matter around me than just being in my own head
all the time.  

To put it concisely, physical exertion is mental rest.  

The control this cycle is going to be magnesium and elevated levels of
cardiovascular training.  

I'll be logging such updates more frequently henceforth and keeping it
a little more dispassionate and pragmatic than usual.
