 - Have converged onto a DE agnostic workflow.  
 - need only a few keybinds to help me move across windows and monitors.  
 - window estate management is done via emacs and tmux : don't really need a tiling wm.
 - opencode when I'm not learning anything and mostly know what needs to be done.
   - open a bunch of these in multiple tmux panes and you're good.
 - a vim-keybinds enabled browser
