I've lately been thinking deeply about how I interact with my computing environments; when working, I've a  
    - an unrooted snapdragon ARM Android with Termux and Tmux for ephemeral vimmin & sshing around when on the move  
    - an Intel x86 FreeBSD home lab for some asynchronous compute that I don't need right away and some redundancy for my important files  
    - a personal ubuntu VPS with a couple of intel x86 vCPUs for my self hosting endeavours and overall context orchestration  
    - several compute clusters (avx enabled x86s, ARM,  "the propietary GPU driver guy on the street" GPUs, "the other open source GPU driver guy on the steet" GPUs, k8s orchestrated production & development playgrounds) for work  
    - an AMD x86 Tumbleweed with emacs as the daily driver where I actually "work" : this is desk where I dissect, analyse, reconstruct and dispatch for usage across the above  
    
There has been this irk that I've catched up on regarding my way of thinking with too much depth as to what is doing what. That's enjoyable and necessary in itself but I feel I'm missing out on a more elegant perspective about this whole -> sort of a lisp machine analogue for this personal compute network.  

Feels like I'm not completely exploiting the machines around me and there's a whole lot of creativity and raw cognitive power that I'm missing out on.  

I might need to meditate upon how I actually think about what I'm actually doing.
