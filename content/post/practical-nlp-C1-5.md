I took this up when I had to setup a bunch of NLP pipelines for work and
this does stand true to its name - it is a quick and practical index
into approaches, introductory theory and useful libraries for the
same.   

I don't like reading text books at a stretch due to several reasons:-
"cross a bridge, when you get to it" is something that has stood the
test of time for me when it comes to reading practical books. I don't
find it useful to read stuff without the doing if that is what the
book is intended for.  

I have been making notes since the second chapter that are indexed
in the sentinel reference of the [NLP node in my
braindump](https://buffer.rajpatil.dev/sitemap?stack=%2F20230713150554-natural_language_processing.html).

I do plan on returning to complete the rest as and when needed.  


Here is an index into the [meta data of the
book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48816582-practical-natural-language-processing?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=UJ1cwpG7xz&rank=1).

I don't rate books anymore and simply post reviews. As of now, I don't
find any shortcomings in this book as it does what it says and has
been on par with my expectations of being a reasonably theoretical and
practical resource to get things running quickly.
