I'm going on a 6-month break from YouTube and will return on March 1, 2025. During this break, I will focus on writing, staying true to the original essence of blogging. Currently, I don't have the content that I believe will benefit my growth on YouTube. While I could produce a lot of click-bait content, that's not my intent with content creation.

I'm working on a couple of complex projects and need to invest heavily in them. This will help me level up my competence in various aspects of my life, which have not been up to the mark for quite a while. Apart from my principal objectives, I'm not reading as much as I would like, my strength levels are not where I want them to be, and my sleep schedule is irregular.

The demand of producing a new video every week is causing me to focus more on presenting what I learn rather than actually learning. This is slowing me down. I want to accelerate my progress and will return after this focused period of growth. I'm not giving up on content creation; I just believe that it should benefit both the consumer and the creator.

While I can make useful content for viewers on YouTube, I see no reason not to build my competence first before talking about topics I'm not completely sure of. Although documenting as a beginner has its benefits, I want to learn for its own sake rather than constantly thinking about content pipelines. My genuine curiosity has been diluted by the lure of pseudo-recognition.

I'll continue blogging about different non-technical aspects of my life. Behind the scenes, I'll be deeply invested in acquiring well-documented tools of the trade, and thus will avoid pushing out mediocre content about tools that don't need more. I'll still log my technical journey in the ideation buffer in an indexed manner, leaving a trail for those who wish to follow. Do expect a lot of chaotic amusement, so follow at your own risk.
