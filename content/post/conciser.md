Speech and the word written, are potential expressions of a
thought. Each one of us enjoys a different mix of how we best convey
ourself.  

Ever since I began blogging when I was 19, I've been prioritising
descriptiveness over precision. I feel I've entered a
mental state where I value the distilled value of the transmission
more than the exhaustiveness of the message.  

I also notice a rift between the way I speak and the way I write. Not
to say that any one of them is superior than the other but I could use
an exercise in convergence - projecting them both onto a common
ground.  

I hypothesize that the act of enforcing a common implicit
representation for my speech and my writing will better enrich the way
I think : for I anticipate the waves of my mind 
when crafting a sentence, and practice intuitively surfing them when
navigating a conversation a certain way.  

This in turn should help me be a better thinker, writer and
conversationalist.  

On to the pragmatics of accelerating this intent into consequences,
I'll be writing more often than usual and would keep it slightly aloof
than what I'm reading currently. Instead, I'll focus on ideas that
I've previously encountered in fragments and try sensibly collating
them.  

Self criticism is another aspect that I'll be translucent about to
really document my progress with the same. For starters I've a
tendency to get a little too abstract, a little to quickly. I've
already deviated quite a bit from what I initially set out to convey
in this micro-essay (this does show a potential market for version
controlled essays). That either highlights the way writing refines
your thought, or.., how raw one's thought is that it requires an hour
of active refinement to really understand what one thinks.  

We shall soon find out, over the following season of abstract musings,
how well I stand true to my promise of iterative convergence - over a
series of relevant blogs (here) and unscripted monologues
([youtube](https://youtube.com/@rajp152k?si=oOuktOD2UUQVnOLL)). If
