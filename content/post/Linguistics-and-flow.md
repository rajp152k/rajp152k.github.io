Understanding different languages can open up one's mind towards
different cultures.  

The evolution of languages over centuries and common ancestors
there-of over millenia indicates the evolution of cultural
complexity.  

## The Conventional Take

I grew up actively conversing in 4 languages on frequent basis (English, Hindi,
Marathi and Gujrati). French was my first romance language I was
exposed to for over 8 years  (I say exposed as was learning this
academically as a third language and didn't use this as a "natural"
language as much as the others).  

I've dabbled a little in Latin and greek
in my junior year of my bachelors (dabbled ~ read an introductory
book) and am currently [getting into sanskrit](https://www.amazon.in/Practical-Grammar-Sanskrit-Language/dp/8121509394) to read up on some
ancient indian literature in the close future.  

Although these, of course, grant me quite the customized perspective of the world
as every polyglot personally hones, they're not the most influential
languages that I've come across to influence my life.  
 
Rather than being a device of communication, I see languages more as a
means to understand a way of thought.  

## The Meta : Premise

I first implicitly learned about grammar, phonetics, and the likes
when I was a toddler, able to convey what I need efficiently, increasing
my likelihood of survival in the longer run.  

I first picked up calculus when I was 14 to better understand physical
phenomena and consequently was able to have slightly more
sophisticated musings on my morning commutes.  

I first formally picked up the lambda calculus model of computation
when I was in my sophomore year of college (I don't know when I
started thinking procedurally (I think all humans pick it up
intuitively over a longer duration when they're young)) and could then
begin understanding some of the more involved aspects of programming
language theory and [experiment with some myself](https://racket-lang.org/).

I then actively delved into the world of symbolic algebra (via
Lisp) which then enabled intense sequences of dreams structured in
s-expressions.  

These are only some of the self-initiated pursuits of mine that over
my life that lead to an immediate bump in my quality of thoughts in
the longer run.  

## The Meta

I consider a "language" in the more epistemological sense in that it
allows me to understand something more elaborately.  

I've been very limiting in how I define my instances above but a
different language could even relate to different mindsets that one
can attune themselves to depending on what the situtation calls for.  

A crude instance for this could be understanding the gradation between
probability theory and luck over the gradual transition of the extent
of your control over a set of events.  

In the larger context of existing across a sequence of events then,
being able to polyglottically (I know that is not a word: termed a neologism) switch to
what serves you best in the moment should best optimize your
comprehension of the abstract phenomena that existence is.  

## What I'm after ..

.. then, is to accumulate as many such abstract epistemological
languages, to better my command over the poetic composition that the
Uni-Verse is.  

This definitely isn't the last of what you'll hear about this from
me.  

## Caveats

I temporarily had pseudo-diagnosed myself with cognitive dissonance (the
abstract stress ) previously and there was a point when I even
regretted reading a little too variedly.  

Although I'm presently enjoy having access to multiple orientations
for attacking a domain (you never know when the tables turn), I'll recommend you gauge your neuro-elasticity before you actively pursue this path, for the perils are many.
