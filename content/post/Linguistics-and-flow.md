*check out what an IKN0x means [here](https://rajpatil.dev/post/ikn0x0/)*

Understanding different languages can open up one's mind towards
different cultures.  

The evolution of languages over centuries and common ancestors
there-of over millenia indicates the evolution of cultural
complexity.  

## The Conventional Take

I grew up actively conversing in 4 languages: English, Hindi,
Marathi and Gujrati. French was my first romance language I was
exposed to for over 8 years  (I say exposed as was learning this
academically as a third language and didn't use this as a "natural"
language as much as the others).  

I've dabbled a little in Latin and Greek
in my junior year of my bachelors (dabbled ~ read an introductory
book) and am currently [getting into sanskrit](https://www.amazon.in/Practical-Grammar-Sanskrit-Language/dp/8121509394) to read up on some
ancient indian literature in the close future.  

Although these, of course, grant me quite the customized perspective of the world
as every polyglot personally hones, they're not the most influential
languages that I've come across to influence my life.  
 
Rather than being a device of communication, I see languages more as a
means to understand a way of thought.  

## The Meta

 - first implicitly learned about grammar, phonetics, and the likes
 when a toddler, thus conveying my needs efficiently, increasing my
 likelihood of survival in the longer run.   

 - first picked up calculus when 14 to better understand physical
 phenomena and consequently was able to have sophisticated musings on
 my school commutes.  

 - first explored lambda calculus in my sophomore year of college
   (don't know when started thinking procedurally (think all
   humans pick it up intuitively over a longer duration when 
   relatively younger)) and could then begin understanding some of the more
   involved aspects of programming language theory and [experiment
   with some myself](https://racket-lang.org/). 

 - soon actively delved into the world of symbolic algebra (via Lisp),
   enabling intense sequences of dreams laden with sexprs.   

These are some of the self-initiated pursuits of mine that led to an
immediate bump in the quality of my thoughts.  

I consider a "language" in the more epistemological sense in that it
allows me to understand something more elaborately.  

Now, a quick search about the etymology of "language" (lingua from
latin meaning tongue) would quickly render my proposition lacking in
prominent ways, but that isn't what I'm going for here.

I've been somewhat terse when recalling the anecdotes above but a
language could be perceived as relating to different mindsets
depending on what the situtation calls for.  

A crude instance for this could be understanding the gradation between
probability theory and luck over the gradual transition of the extent
of your control over a set of events.  

In the larger context of existing across a sequence of events then,
being able to polyglottically (neologism) switch to
what serves you best in the moment should best optimize your
comprehension of existence.

Being a responsible logger I should mention that I temporarily had
pseudo-diagnosed myself with cognitive dissonance (the psychological
stress associated with juggling perceivably contradicting views)
previously and there was a point when I even regretted my voracious
intellectual appetite.  

Although I presently enjoy having access to multiple orientations for
attacking a domain (intermittently do feel otherwise), I'll
recommend you gauge your neuro-elasticity before you actively pursue
this path, for the perils may perish your perspecives.  

I shall explore the downsides in detail in the posts that follow
soon.  

## Ultimately, what I'm after ..

.. then, is to accumulate as many such abstract epistemological
languages, to better my command over the poetic composition that the
Uni-Verse is.  

This definitely isn't the last of what you'll hear about this from
me.
