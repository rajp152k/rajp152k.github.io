"For years, I've defended lisp in pragmatism oriented SWE back and forths with 'they're all an AST underneath, anyway.."

Now that I'm writing lisp on the job, I'm in a "gotta catch'em all" kinda mood and thinking of elaborating upon the eccentricities in my upcoming blogs and videos.  

There's a lot of questions I have:  
    - when do you deploy which one?  
    - are there any bad ones?  
    - why does that one exist?  
    - ..  

chasing that enlightenment : going all in on the lisp build in when it comes to my SWE career for a while ..  

so far, it's been Hy, Racket, Common Lisp, and now Clojure : need to start getting into the distinctions rather than just the common abstractions (already been doing that for a while) that make a lisp a lisp : would help me better answer the cause of their exististence ig ..
