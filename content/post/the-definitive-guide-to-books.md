Books play a pivotal role in the life of any aspiring and existing intellectual. I began
reading diversely and seriously when I was 19 and immediately
regretted not starting sooner.  

Reading sets you up for an involved existence. If you read vastly,
you'll be a force to be reckoned with.  

Over the span of 3 years (2019 - 2022), I read around a 100 books ranging from
the classics, biographies, auto-biographies, physics, computer science,
anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history,
how-to-books, nutrition, physiology , fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics,
business (okay, don't judge - we all do this), economics, writing,
self help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being
funny and similar stuff), young adult (only 1 - please don't chastise
me - I could not handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot - please don't chastise
me) and meta books (speed reading, how to consume books, taking notes,
etc).  

I probably did miss out on some very eccentric oddity 
that could put me up there in the league of undiagnosed sociopaths - I
recited that list based on what I could recall. (I've deleted my old
goodreads (the one linked is a new index that I'm still building) that had these indexed, for a fresh start -> too many shelves
and tags and I'm more of a destroyer than I'm a cleaner).

The habit of reading may have granted me access to the ocean of abstractions
and intellectual entities but writing is the guru that teaches you
how to swim and dive and evaporate seas and make it rain on
deserts and communicate with marine life and unlock secrets from the
deepest trenches and generate tsunamis and ... well ..., yeah ..., you
get the point..  

I have blogged regularly for the majority of my last 4 years of
existence and then felt like writing a book after a point. I felt so for the
first time a year and a half ago but circumstances (code for excuses
and procrastination) did not align the stars for me to get that off my
check list.  

Yesterday, while cooking my morning post workout feast, in [this
podcast](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26469916/), Derek (Sivers)
discussed the idea of writing a book by building a series of blog
posts.  

Writing a blog post seems easier than writing down a
chapter of similar complexity. It also encourages intermittent
feedback rather than a final review of your ideas. I liked the concept
and have finally decided to begin writing my book about "The
definitive guide to books".  

It should serve as a good entry point for any lexically starved 
individual (as I was when I began) on how to go about reading
diversely, efficiently and consolidating all that you consume in a
dense and mentally index-able manner.  

The final piece of the puzzle for any bibliophile to graduate into a
telepath of abstractions is writing a book. That shall be the final
section of my first book and I'll be collating the experiences of
writing these book-oriented blog posts into that final section.  

Discussing my plans is a habit that keeps me accountable and pushes me
harder on actually sticking to the promise made to no specific
individual but to the edges of the internet that won't be read so easily
by those who actually care - that is something I would do:
pseudo-accountability taken to the extreme.  

"Do let me know what you think of this confession and commitment in the
comments below" is a very generic call-to-action I could use, but that
doesn't matter if I actually don't write the book now.
