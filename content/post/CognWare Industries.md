I'm a Philosopher (etymologically speaking, I do love wisdom).  

[CognWare Industries](https://cognware.com) was established on the 1st of May to  philosophically channel my cognitive energies.  


Explicitly addressing them allows me to separate out my identities of being technicality oriented (in here) and being too abstract (given the lisp aficionado that I am).

Of course, a fusion of being overtly-abstract and over-engineering my thoughts are fundamental to my operations and my personalit(y/ies).  

Allocating dedicated sandboxes will allow them to get out of each other's way..  

I've begun splitting my personas and being more reflective as you may already observe..  

As for the current observer that orchestrates the swarm of all of my splits (many go undocumented and are still unrealized), the [DD0xes](/dd0x/) will hopefully serve as a favourable base of meta-programmatic head quarters..
