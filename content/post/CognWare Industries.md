I'm a Philosopher (not just a wannabe: etymologically speaking, I do love wisdom).  

[CognWare Industries](https://cognware.com) was established on the 1st of May to explicitly address my urges to philosophically channel my cognitive energies.  


Explicitly addressing them allows me to separate out my identities of being highly technicality oriented (in here) and being explicitly abstract (given the lisp aficionado that I am).

Of course, a fusion of being overtly-abstract and over-engineering my thoughts are fundamental to my operations and my personalit(y/ies).  

Allocating dedicated sandboxes will allow them to get out of each other's way..  

I've already begun splitting my personas and being slightly more reflective as you may observe..  

As for the current observer personna that orchestrates the swarm of all of my splits (many go undocumented and are still unrealized), the [DD0xes](/dd0x/) will hopefully serve as a favourable base of meta-programmatic head quarters..
