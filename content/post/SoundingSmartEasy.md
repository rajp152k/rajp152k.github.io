I'm personally vulnerable to coming off as a smart
individual. Whenever people see me talk, they do think I've my
priorities sorted out and know what I'm doing.  

Honestly, I'm just as confused as every other 22 year old out there
trying to figure out where to channel all that ambition they
harbor. A good anchor that helps me in carrying my present
circumstances with me when I'm day dreaming is the habit of reading
diverse content that varies across a huge time span(I don't do fiction).

Consuming only recently authored content is a mistake that many who
want to stay in the know make. I personally have a distaste for
current affairs because of all the misinterpretation that
goes into it: you never know what is really happening and can only
react based on someone else portraying what someone else might be
experiencing. That's a little too many points of failures for
effective communication.  

Reading ancient texts is something that does help one see the bigger
picture but they can pull you out of the present and make you somewhat
of an outcast. Again, if you do wish to build good stuff, you'll need
to meet competent people that are alive and not just documented
accounts of great people.  

Podcasts are a great way to fit in content whenever one's on the move
but they can never compete with the depth that a good book
provides. One's the result of careful thought over a much longer
duration and the other is an over the top skim of something
potentially much deeper than it is being portrayed right now.  

The human brain, at least mine, does catch on to the domain specific
jargon being employed pretty quickly and it makes it much easier for
me to throw words around that I don't grasp with credible depth.  

This is why I throw around disclaimers about being inexperienced in a
particular domain whenever engaging in a conversation beyond what I've
read; It's always good to be safe rather than ashamed in terms of what
you claim to know.  

The problem is that most people look for direct orders rather than
appropriate reasoning to go along with it whenever they make decisions
regarding a domain they haven't explored personally. Now, in the short
term, you may be saving up on time, but in the long term, you
sacrifice your intellectual independence - you may be forced to fill in a
trust vacuum later on for your sources of information.  

Given that it is scarce to find a source that doesn't work for
symbolic profit, one can always fall prey to the lexical halo effect.  

The human mind is socially-engineerable into thinking an idea/entity
is worth significantly more than it's approximately real value by
marketing tricks and leveraging one's not so cognizant affinity towards things that
look good.  

A principle reason for this is the unconscious malicious use of
one of the core principles of rhetoric : repetition.  

Given any creation can be propagated easily via social media these
days, it's quite possible that one could misuse such platforms to
forcefully align the sentiments of the masses to create movements that
might be based on very superficial assumptions.  

Immunizing myself from these sentiment cycles is a priority for me
because they range from the trends that are a distraction from getting
some real work done, investment advice that could be a big pump and
dump under the hood, movements that you can't do much about to help
forward but only nod in agreement and share an unnecessary stress,
hype about some new symbolic progress in a domain that you had nothing
to do with and won't affect your life in any way whatsoever, and on
and on...  

This is why I'm choosing to cut down my sources of information and
definitely avoiding any current affairs stuff. I anyway will only be
participating in some fundamental investments and don't need to follow
the market. While selecting these sources, I go for wisdom adapted to
modern times instead of some research backed but untested idea that
doesn't have an effect on my life for the moment being.  

At last, it's the execution and follow-through of an idea that matters
more than the conception itself. In my pursuit of being creative, I
am comparatively lazier when it comes to the execution and consuming
content that is carefully crafted for incentives beyond my scope of
comprehension doesn't quite help.
