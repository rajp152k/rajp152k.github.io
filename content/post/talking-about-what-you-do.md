I haven't been writing quite as much as I'd like to lately and have
been considering how I approach the whole thing.  

Instead of talking about what I'm thinking in the moment (pretty
fleeting), I'm ......  

This is exactly the point where I'll go "I'm planning on ..." : I do
not wish like doing that anymore. Talking about my momentary plans for
a while has been quite the distraction that I occasionally enjoy.  

Now, I'm ....  

There I go again, again had the urge to declare a plan. What is with
this human urge to declare their plans rather than just getting on
with what you wish to do.  

Hitherto, I've been doing this across multiple discplines and have
been missing out the point of what I wished writing to be when I
started out.  

It started out as a way to understand my mind in a more intricate
manner. Over time, I pivoted to the literal we`b-log`ging aspect and
would log about anything and  everything that I was getting myself
into at that moment in time.  

Over the span of multiple writing styles, ranging from downright deranged day
dreaming, to terse technical texts, to pseudo-philosophical
psychosocial sections of my brain's musings, to wishy-washy wanna-be alliterative compositions
with the childish tendency for unnecessary lexical play, I could say
I've fairly captured a significant amount of my thinking
modalities.  

What for though, is what I wonder..  

As of now, there isn't an explicitly tangible response to that nor an immediate
denial of utility that pops up.  

I feel I need a purpose-less vagabond-ish block of blogging to recalibrate what I'm really after.  

To not leave you (mostly me years down the lane revisiting this
in an intellectually adrift state) high and dry, an explicit
recommendation would be to double down on the randomness and let
reversion to the mean do its thing over a series over purposeless
productions.  

This is probably the first piece of public writing, addressed to my future self.
