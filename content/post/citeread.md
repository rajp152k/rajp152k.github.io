From time to time, I like to make minor tweaks to my blog based on the treasure trinklets I find around in different corners of the internet from blogs/works of personalities I follow/find interesting.  

I got into the practice of logging updates in reverse chronological streams from one of my professors in my sophomore year.  

I began personalized hex timestamps (today is 0x2360 for me) because I don't intuitively gel well with the (Julian -> Gregorian) cycles. The combination of lunar, solar and planetary cycles is my most recent experimental initiative for calibrating long term efforts but that would be a little too chaotic for the part of the world wide web that I mostly interact with these days.  

Microessays are something that I converged upon to keep my writing endeavors regular. Large essays are good for consolidating noise-free signals through phases of your life but the duration's slightly long to account for the whimsical intellectual anomalies I'd like to be captured.  

I chanced upon the concept of the "Now" page (https://nownownow.com/about)  from Derek Sivers blog.  

I build my ideation buffer, node by node, from multiple minor and major ideas from books, blogs, existing open source knowledge graphs, some trial and error, and loads of intellectual fun..  

I've recently taken to building [an index](https://buffer.thebitmage.com/sitemap?stack=%2F20250101161813-resumes.html) of interesting blogs (active, aggressive WIP) that I do check out from time to time when I'm in the mood : I'm not the regular RSS feed reading kind.  

I'm missing out on tons of great sources of inspiration so I decided to have a micro-essay, here onwards, whenever I find one worth integrating as a regular practice.  

I liked the idea of having a [PaperShelf](https://arpitbhayani.me/papershelf) from [Arpit's](https://arpitbhayani.me/) blog.  

I've been a regular goodreads user and would enjoy something like that for papers. Google a little and reddit threads yield [citeread](https://citeread.com): here's my [profile](https://citeread.com/users/67b183a15a18eae4d6084ee7) if you'd like to follow along on what I'm reading.  

I'm starting out with the computer sciences but hope to read more holistically over the span of my life.
