## On tangibility of the past

All of us create content, every moment, tuned to varying extents of influence and
permanence.  

It's intent that separates us all into different leagues of
producers.  
Let me explain via a hierarchical build up of selected formats of content with
varying intensity.  
Note that the list isn't exhaustive by any means and I've deliberately
excluded works of larger scale (movies, video games : they have the
potential to be the most influential kind of content out there).  

1. **Memories:** Personal reflections for self, minimal intent beyond preserving moments.

2. **Photos and Videos:** Captured experiences for personal enjoyment and sharing with friends and family, moderate intent for preserving and sharing life highlights.

3. **Journal Entries:** Personal thoughts for self or select readers, growing intent for self-expression.

4. **Social Media Posts:** Daily updates for social circles, moderate to high intent for sharing moments.

5. **Vlogs:** Video diaries for followers, moderate to high intent for personal connection.

6. **Podcasts:** Audio discussions for niche or general listeners, moderate to high intent for sharing insights.

7. **Blogs:** Knowledge sharing for a diverse online audience, high intent for educating and engaging.

8. **Books:** In-depth guides for readers, high intent for sharing expertise.

9. **Autobiography:** A comprehensive life story for readers, high intent for sharing a personal journey.

These are tangible realizations of indices into our
past. There also exist psychological indices that one creates when
that don't completely fall into the category of being a memory:
working on a project for a long time, so much so that it becomes a
part of your life temporarily and allows you to recall exactly how the
days passed when working on it.  

## Serves me well, this pursuit ...

For me, reading books with a definite purpose suited to my learning
pursuits has been such a strong creator of psychological indices that
I could recite my lifestyle when I was reading a particular book and
what unique characteristic was different about my life then.  

Around two years ago, I remember being able to recite and
consolidate my days during all the hundred diverse books I'd read when
I crossed that checkpoint.

It was a revelation. I wasn't aware that I had the ability to remember
so densely, something that hadn't been physically recorded.  

That was the first time I understood the power of consuming and creating content
with intent.  

I began blogging again recently and I'd forgotten some major aspects
of my life post a minor rough patch. I read my old blogs some while
ago and I was able to recall the characteristics of my old self, all
the philosophical ramblings I'd already progressed with and all the
metaphysical checkpoints my personality had achieved.  

That wouldn't have been possible hadn't I been blogging regularly for
the major half of my bachelors. I was able to capture the most formative
years of my life and record the psychological adaptations and growth
through it.  

It wasn't just the blogs, but all the activities that were done with
intent that created such strong indices that allowed me to be more
self-reflective and be able to know myself better. The habit of
blogging only serves as a maturing agent of sorts, consolidating and
solidifying these malleable memories.  

If not for the habit of blogging, I still would do a lot of the things
I did but I would be a completely different person for the nature of my
consolidation phases would've been comparatively fluffier.  

## What chapter?

Your unaltered perspective about your own life
,captured at regular, frequent instances will probably produce a fairly
noisy and jittery signal. The past is what actually stabilizes your
perception of your present and highlights probable trajectories for
your future.  

Your absolute past is definite and no one's ever aware of the complete
truth (what is that really?). Your perception of your past, however, is again a variable that is dependent on your noisy present. If you'd like being anchored to a
specific trajectory or at least have a stable outlook towards
uncertainty for your future. I'd consider imparting some inertia to
your perceptions.  

Writing (maintaining journals, for starters) is definitely the perfect
tool in your arsenal which requires deliberate focus. It gives you the option 
to be extremely intentional with what you put down in words.  

Even if you have a noisy present, penning down a page or two about
what's on your mind rids you of the noise that allows you to get on
with actually extracting what really needs to be captured.  

I'd put it right alongside a long music-free run at the crack of
dawn - after the initial grind and post finding the groove it
frees you of your intense emotions and your irrational biases,
allowing you to think appropriately, as life always demands
(being care-free is a luxury not many of us can afford).  

With this inertial anchor of perspectives at your disposal, you can
lay down a path of breadcrumbs from your past into your present,
making your personality's progress tractable.  

It helps you structure past chapters in your life,
while planning for future ones robustly which is quite the superpower
any protagonist would enjoy while formulating their own story.  

## The most important book you'll ever read ..

.. is the one you write about yourself...  

Put yourself out there and write your own story. You may not start out
with a book but video logs or social media posts. I'd recommend
consolidating it at regular intervals via blogs and chapters for
phases of your life to finally be compiled into your own version of
your story. Just the act of wanting to pack your life densely into a
story might encourage you to live a little more adventurously with the
drive to give the protagonist a life worth living.  

Build your character arc and record it - in hopes of encouraging
the future generations to do the same, helping them elevate themselves
from the problems you faced by the solutions you consolidated.  

As of now, I personally have inspired a handful humans to start
writing and the feeling induced when I read their works is that of
having created more fellow consolidators that epistemologically forward the world , word by word...

Hope, this blog adds more to that list. Do let me know about your
personal logging pursuits (blogs, art pages, books, video logs) in the
comments.
