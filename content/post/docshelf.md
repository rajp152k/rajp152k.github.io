Lately realized that I like reading the docs: don't know if such a psychological disorder has been classified so far but I'm going to lean into it, for humanity's sake, and document how my condition unfolds.  

I, implicitly, have gathered a certain corpus of incommunicable collation of engineering wisdom (/ overenginering foolery?), surfing the architectural and conceptual sections of docs in quite some well-known, mystical, ancient or infamous sections of the internet.  

The docshelf has been established on 0x23FC[^1] [here](/docshelf/)

do consider reading up on how I got into [shelving stuff](/post/citeread/)
