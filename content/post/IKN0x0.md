# Context

I intend to formalize my plans of getting good at multiple domains not
for the reputation that follows but for the generic insight about the
world that you may harness as a result.  

This is the second refactor of the way I approach this subject and
this time around I will be pushing for practical indicators that allow
me to gauge my progress over time.  

Initially, I wish to establish sound, but nascent (will maintain
flexibility initially) foundations over the course of
docuementing the evolution of my thoughts.  

In the last 5 years I have accumulated a somewhat interesting world
view that I wish to start consolidating in a structure manner to
better file relevances and accomodate developments in the same.  

# Documentation

The documentation will be synchronized vlog and blog releases that capture the evolution of this personal domain over time. 

A cluster root has been initialized in the [ideation buffer](https://buffer.rajpatil.dev/sitemap?stack=%2F20240331194014-ikn0xes.html)
that will track the developments in an elaborate and fine grained
manner compared to what is posted on the main blog.  

A relevant video playlist will also be initialized soon where I will
capture the growth of this epistemological personal project over time.

I plan all releases being concise captures, the format of which I'll
converge upon in due time, over multiple iterations. 

# Nomenclature and Release Cycle

An IKN0x is short for:
 - I
 - K(now)
 - N(ot)
 - 0x(timestamp of number of days I've been alive)
 
The first three are a pointer to [recursive poem](https://rajpatil.dev/i-know-not/) published
around 2 years ago which captures my attitude towards generic
knowledge fairly succintly
