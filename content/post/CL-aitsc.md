Given I've passed through SICP once, quickly grasping common
lisp to build stuff and explore the
traditional and industrial aspects of lisp (I know clojure exists but
traditional...) was my next objective: with decent speed and only
solving the somewhat involved exercises, it took me two weeks to
complete the book.  

The exercises aren't meant to be a challenge but to adapt to the
environment and the concepts introduced. The book does not explore
concepts with depth (CLOS, macros, etc...) but that shouldn't be the
objective of an introduction anyway.  

This is a good stepping stone to get started with common-lisp if
you've already dipped your toes into a scheme (I did SICP with
Racket). When pick this up as your first experience with lisp, I'll
recommend completing all the exercises and not skimming as I did.  

On that note, the next book that I'm tackling is "Practical Common
Lisp". I do maintain active notes of anything that I learn on my
braindump and a quick search in the index should highlight all the
technical details.
