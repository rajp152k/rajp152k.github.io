I couldn't have asked for a denser review of such a technical and
diverse domain. It'd been more a year since I graduated (majored in
computer science and minored in artificial intelligence) and so I
decided to brush up on some basics and consolidate what I'd studying
since the past ~4 years.  

I also picked up the book to systematically populate my org-roam
buffer and have my root node rooted [here in the
braindump](https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20230911114632-the100pagemlbook.html).  

Do note that I avoid noting concepts down verbatim and always try to
write stuff down the way I'd like to formulate it for my future self.  

This is the official distribution site of the book:
https://themlbook.com/  

I wouldn't particularly recommend this for beginners (a more
pedagogically friendly course is a better intro to such a dense
field : I personally began properly with the Fast.AI series but
there's many more respectable intros out there) but would rate it as an extremely useful revision index into the domain.  

When researching/working in the industry, one usually delves
into a particular subdomain. That's necessary and all but this book
did help me in forming a better bigger picture of the field and did so
very quickly to be honest : I log my work sessions with the  org-mode
timing system and it took me around 14 hours to read the book from end
to end while formulating my notes in the brain dump.  

I do want to get onto some more academically inclined reads soon - a
little busy with work and personal pursuits as of now to continue with
a dense and large read right away.
