I like tiling window managers:
    - use i3wm on my Debain home lab
    - used sway on Fedora as my last DD for some time
    
After messing up Fedora in a fairly intractible manner, I moved on to OpenSuse Tumbleweed with btrfs snapshots enabled by default.  

Having already rolled back a couple of times, It's been worth it.  

Because Tumbleweed has been touted as the best KDE integration out there, I chose to go with that.  

Using krohnkite and a several customizations tuned towards a multimonitor setup, I do have a polished tiling-window management setup now.  

The way I achieved this was not a path-indenpendent (declarative) manner though (no single source of truth as well) and not proud of that.  

It does work now though and my productivity levels are better than they were on sway.
