During a recent surf, I chanced upon this beast.

Thinking about compiling more such landmarks -- an itinerary for fellow cyber pilgrims  

Reviewing older codebases is an underrated exercise for software engineers  

It's a journey through the evolution of code, revealing  the engineering decisions that moulded what we deal with today   

Tracing the history of a project – understanding what worked, what didn't, and how technical components evolved – has been a joy lately  

Grateful that we get to stand on the shoulders of giants and enjoy the intellectual sky line  

I, however, would also like to periodically raid the basements, the bunkers, the dungeons, and hell, if you will -- to grasp what structurally and temporally guided "the infra"  

Thinking of starting a YouTube series around software archaeology  

Stay tuned for some time travel
