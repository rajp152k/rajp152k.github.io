I can claim my fair share of distro-hopping and window-manager shopping.

---

### Daily Driver

    - arch + i3 (xorg)
        - broke that in 2 weeks
    - qubes + ...
        - failed installation with kernel panics
    - fedora + sway (wayland)
        - broke that in 6 months
    - opensuse + kde + krohnkite (xorg)
        - broke it thrice
        - rolled back with snapper
        
### Home Lab

    - debian + i3 (xorg)
    - debian + KDE (wayland)
    - freeBSD + ttys 
        - still messing around

KDE is great and all but I miss pure window manager experience. [Snapper](https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/reference/html/book-reference/cha-snapper.html) is a life saver so I'm continuing with TumbleWeed.

As of 0x2327 (2024-12-21 18:26:18 IST), I've decided to move onto [stumpwm](https://stumpwm.github.io/index.html); for I could definitely use a some more lisps around me.
