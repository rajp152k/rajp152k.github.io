One of my cousin's getting hitched and maneuvering your way through "the great indian wedding" while sticking to your nutritional routine is tough.  

Not so much because you lack self control (that's the easy part and have that figured out) but more because all the relatives are out there stuffing delicacies down your throat at all times through a whole bunch of ceremonies (I don't have enough fingers to keep up with the  count).  

Denial backed by rationales like you're on a cut or that it doesn't fit your macros is not going to cut it.  

Indian relatives can be *very* stubborn and what I've found works is just declaring that I'm diabetic: they don't force me any further.  

PS: I'm not diabetic
