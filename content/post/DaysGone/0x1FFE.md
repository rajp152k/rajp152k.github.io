I do enjoy blogging in terms of streams, while keeping it discrete
enough for convenient rereads.  

	- will be initializing a daily stream that I initialize every
      morning and end at the end of every day.  
	- timestamps somehow increase my awareness of time and delegate
      the stress of time-management to the computer.  
	  - feels like a very simple productivity hack.  
	- I borderline feel like Mark Watney from "Martian".  
    - story-telling is an interesting art I'd like to improve in on
      the sidelines and logging has been an accelerator for the same
      in the past.  
	- there is not much value in one entry, but, accumulate them over a
      large span of time and you have something interesting.  
	- taking a break from intense physical workouts for a week and
      solidifying some core work rituals (for programming, studying,
      reading and writing) for the next year or so.  
    - will still be walking with podcasts so my body will get some
      much needed rest.  
    - I do need to decouple my workouts from the productivity aspect
      of my work; they definitely elevate my efficiency but sometimes,
      I just enjoy going all in with work and finishing off major
      projects.  
	- Finishing of the books "Practical Common Lisp" and "Fluent
      Python" in the following week.  
	- I keep my studies independent from my work and going forward, will be
      getting into "Let Over Lambda" and "Hacking: The art of exploitation".
	- My casual reading pursuits include finishing off Taleb's "Incerto" series
      in the coming weeks.  
		  - will be reviving my speed reading skills
		  - quite a controversial topic in the reading community
		  - will be writing about this in detail soon to lay out what
            it is down to the core.
		  - it definitely gets a bad rep due to it being somewhat of a
            misnomer.
		  - I hate misnomers: I used to redefine words on my old blog
            but this time, I'm thinking of sticking to the bounds of
            the language I'm using and not creating novel words.
		  - will be efficient in the long term.
	- Reading and writing are activities that do not provide you a
      benefit in the short term but definitely pay off in the generic
      wisdom and awareness you gain over the longer term.
	- This is something the society doesn't acknowledge yet.
	- We technically can capture knowledge with success within technical textbooks but
      we haven't really dialed down on what can really encapsulates
      wisdom.
	- 0x2000 is coming soon and will mark a new phase of my life : I'm
      done with 8192 days and I'll be entering 0x3000 in my early
      thirties.
	  - Writing with timestamps is like creating a time capsule.
	  - It allows you to move on from the past without holding on to
        it. 
	  - You've neatly indexed your memories and incentives (which can
        easily be manipulated by circumstances in the future). 
		- does delegate away the stress in defining who you are.
		- That sounds good to me.
	- still need to restructure the site a little...
	- need to backup all my past work and documents in a smarter way
	- already initialized system logs for maintaing progress as a descriptive
      function of time: for backtracks and identifying where things
      went wrong in the long run.
	- have reinitialized my rough observation journals and am building
      that curiosity again.
	- It does get you in trouble sometimes, but, well, life's boring
	anyway.
		- A little trouble sounds good to me.
