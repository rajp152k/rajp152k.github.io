I wrestle with boredom from time to time: probably because I maintain a healthy addiction for novelty.  

Although my days are scheduled along with a mostly invariable undercurrent of overarching directives, a deliberate portion of "something new" keeps me engaged and aware in the longer run.  

This idea of needing "something new" everyday has become the most recent constant in my life: to the point of me considering adopting a "new new" of "nothing new for a while and seeing how that feels".  

Imagine not doing anything new for a few days (four to be precise, ending two days ago) is the "new new" in one's life : how spoilt does one have to be for that to be a precondition for an experiment.  

This does affect my operations, in several manners: the funkiest of them all is me explicitly spending thought on what can I do better when I do not have grounds to judge the outcomes of the last run yet.  

All that I partake in (tangibles and the abstracts), in this certain mindset, is "One off".  

I need to change my need to need change to a somewhat more harmonic frequency.  

I, however, do not completely denounce the benefits of maintaining such a state of mind: I'm not aware enough, yet, to present them here to balance it all out.
