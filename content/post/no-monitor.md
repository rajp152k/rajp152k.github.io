I recently have moved on from using monitors and am working (professional and writing endeavours) only via a 13 inch laptop. It is definitely a different workflow than what I'm used to.  

It has been around 10 days I've been doing this and here are some observations:  
 - I'm able to focus better as I'm forced to enlarge my context maintaining capabilities; for I don't have the luxury to look back and forth with just my eye movements.    
 - I can work from anywhere. I change places and posture every 1.5 hours, 5 times a day.  
 - Given I move between a couple of meets during the day, I don't have to adjust to differing window management mannerisms as I only ever work on the same screen now.  
 - I work in at most two splits now compared to the 5+ previously: it is all simpler and the monitor has started to seem like a vanity rather than essential accessory.  
 - I don't have to switch keyboards between my desk and meets: I don't mess enough as much now.  
 - I can start looking down upon people that are bound to monitors, thinking that they're spoiled or aren't minimal enough.  
 - I've started preaching about the spartan-ish effects of working only via your laptop  
 - I spend more time on screen, on my bed: consequently I'm writing more.  
 
I definitely do miss reading papers and books on a larger vertically oriented screen but I'm going to stick to this for a while.
