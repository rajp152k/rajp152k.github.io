For a while, I'd limited my studying endeavours to be project oriented and not domain oriented. While I enjoy the pragmatism of the former, I also wish to build up my innate curiosity to get under the hood, disassemble the engine and be able to put it back together: no project (except the explicit choice of doing so) is going to help me fit that in my studies.  

Consequently, I'm planning on getting started with a regulary habit of exploring domains with depth.  

Although I will not be able to allocate any payoffs in my career explicitly to any papers read in the moment, I am certain of the long term benefits towards my pursuit of competence.  

I'll be directing my efforts towards understanding, dissecting and exploring harder problems in the larger scope of computer science.  

The title serves as a mnemonic into the strategy I plan to employ:
 - rapidly index the literature under review and prepare for a deep pass
 - heavily scrutinize and connect all dots and critically analyse loopholes and merits
 - communicate/teach findings with relevant personnel, extract feedback, improve my understanding and iterate

This is a step towards my long running desire of maintaining a personal research lab dedicated towards analysing an ambitious pool of problem statements to analyse with depth.
