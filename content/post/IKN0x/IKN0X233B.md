*check out what an IKN0x means [here](https://thebitmage.com/post/ikn0x0/)*

[ICBM](https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20250109100230-icbm_intellectual_cluster_bootstrap_methodology.html), in here, is an abbreviation for the "Intellectual Cluster Bootstrap Methodology".  

I've only recently began enjoying the joys of maintaining scaffolds in multiple intellectual domains.  

Given you maintain good generic fundamentals of various root domains, you get to enjoy grasping new specific ones in an expedited manner.  

These days when I have to assimilate a previously unseen domain, a weekend long pragmatic study marathon yields results comparable to what would've required at least a week, before [I deliberately chose](https://github.com/rajp152k/19-22_archive/blob/3579ed21d07e2c52aeb218e409693f54872e2a6b/_posts/books/2020-11-09-LdaV.md) to set out on this path.  

Here are the crude aspects revolving around setting up the Launch.  

## Ingredients

### [You need to take notes](https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20240804175210-how_to_take_notes.html)

 - Never start with a blank page: you always know something, however trivial, about anything.  
 - Always [capture](https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20230925094832-gtd_starter_kit.html) whatever intrigues you.  
   - even if you don't consume it at that moment in time, enqueue it for latter reference.  
 - slowly grow your corpus of awareness, word by word and curate/consolidate branches into distilled nodes from time to time.   
 - Be [shameless and upfront about how incorrect](https://buffer.thebitmage.com/?#orgb417cd6) you could be
 - Be unforgivingly meticulous with the miscellaneous details.  
   - more is always better than less, in the case of ingesting intellect, for you can always prune later down the line but will not be in the same state of mind again to inspire this certain thought you're wondering about storing.  
 - balance rigor and play: don't sacrifice either.  
 
### Revisit your Notes Regularly

 - I personally conduct weekly refactors and slowly chip away at [the monster](https://buffer.thebitmage.com/sitemap?) that I'm building up
 - Makes for a good intellectual hack-n-slash with some metal
 
### Read, a lot

 - you need to maintain a baseline level of voraciousness and maintain a high reading over thinking ratio.  
   - spells of thinking without consuming will help with breakthroughs from time to time.  
   - but you sacrifice precious time if you don't do the homework, masked by the greed of publishing pseudo-original works.  
 - Everything goes.  
  - don't have to punish yourself for reading random stuff.  
 - Everything should go.  
  - do punish yourself for only reading with a unidimensional mindset.  

### The Edge and the Node

 - structure the Node around [First Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle): this helps widen your grasp in unique manners so that you don't intern handicap clusters that just leech other root domains.  
   - you may have dependent projections, but don't claim them to be root.  
 - have several edges to capture connections between root clusters: this helps densen your grasp.  
 
### The Eagle Eye

 - Zoom out from time to time and observe.  
 - build domains dealing with "domains" in an abstract manner.  
   - this blog is an ICBM launch based on the notion of launching ICBMs.  
 - question your works, dissect your works, find flaws, appreciate your innocent efforts of the past, refactor with pride, and iterate.  

### [Day Dream](https://thebitmage.com/dd0x/)

 - be scary ambitious with your ideas and be aware that you're being stupid.  

## The ICBM

Now that you're used regularly indulging in the above delicacies individually, it's time to bring them all together and cook.  

### The Heat of Intent

 - there is a time for play and a time for the mission mindset.  
 - intentfully choose to focus on particular objectives with deadlines.  
 - If you've been maintaining the fertility of your mind with the habits above, the seeding thoughts growth will be accelerated with intent.  
 
### Launch

 - set off the ICBM, towards your target, and don't lose sight of what you sought out in the beginning.  

### Surveillance

 - You'll be tempted to fork your efforts into other domains along the way..  
 - instead, capture the psuedo-seed for latter consumption.  
   - you're not sacrificing curiosity but taming it with discipline and allowing yourself to invoke it at will.  
 - but don't give up on the initial target until you get there.  

### Explode & Destroy

 - Collect all your findings in your notes  
 - don't be afraid to archive existing domain clusters if you find them to be outdated  
 - setup links with all nodes that remotely resemble your current ideation state.  

### Micro ICBMs
 
 - launch minor campaigns if you seem to lack coverage.  
 - iterate until satisfaction.  
 
### Claim your findings

 - in a consolidated manner in summary nodes for quick skims latter down the line.  
 - publish them and share what you learned - accelerating the accumulation of collective intelligence.  

## Let Yourself Cook

 - Deliberately have phases where you let your clusters simmer and fuse and collide.  
 - Let entropy and evolution do their own thing and build a stronger, chaos resistant cluster civilization.  
 - Before you launch further major ICBMs cause you miss the chaos, let the dust settle all over, let the ripples dampen for the oceans to be clearer and then,  
 - Reflect.

Enjoy the fruits of your labor : you've now assimilated a bleeeding and leading edge epistemological weapon to better understand the world around you.  

Go on, conquer away..
