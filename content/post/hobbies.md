Onboarding my next batch of hobbies you would sorta care about:  
 - software defined radio - was gifted (I asked for it explicitly) an RTL SDR kit   
 - hacking - hacking the art of exploitation is my bedtime read  
 - operating systems : writing an operating system - is what I promised my the (bit-mage)'s viewers lately : a promise, is a promise
 - random wikipedia : I'm bored of the world and sorta intellectually hangry
 
stuff you wouldn't care about:  
 - picking up the keyboard (the music kind) again  
 - selling my old honda car and buying a new honda bike   
 - talking about reading more  
 - writing more  
 - not caring a lot
