 - I'd always wanted to write production lisp: was dreaming about it since sophomore year of uni (~7 years to that): finally.., we're here
 - going to start work on [goose](https://github.com/nilenso/goose) : along the way, chasing that lisp flow/enlightenment I once experienced long ago
 - post discussions with some folks, clojure isn't supposed the vanilla lisp and aspects orthogonal to that mindset await to be grasped
 - going for a focused burst of immersion (practical coupled with a literature sweep (blogs, papers, books)) to really get a feel for what's up
 - have been going easy for the past couple of years when it comes to levelling up on my lisp speak because there was always some work I had to get done 
 - interesting that this is work now, long way..
