One cannot rely on objective standardized tests to gauge how good one is at the act of being.  

They're good to indicate a specific aspect of where you wish to affirm your competence in, but have exhibit numerous fallacies when you're trying to optimize a probabilistic, unstructured, instinct based behaviour over longer spans of durations, ranging from weeks to decades.  

Such a gauge is probably only exhaustively captured in how the complexities of life unroll around you based on your behaviours.  

Albeit, there does seem to be an efficient approximation function for the aforementioned vaster objective that just might help you iterate faster in shorter temporal durations.  

What's even more challenging is maintaining that feeling and staying in the goldilocks zone:  
 - not too exhausted  
 - not too relaxed  
 - just right.., "resonant" rings just fine.  
 
I'd like to think of it as an calm, but aggressive awareness of whatever you're participating in, in the moment. It allows the flexibility of accomodating your creatives sways, while pruning natural entropy's eventual effects.  

This state of being that I describe, I've gained and lost it a bunch of times over the past 5 years. I don't quite know the route to it. All I can ascertain about it is that, you don't experience it without investing some serious efforts (although finally, it all flows and feels effortless) but you do lose it if serious externalities consume too much of your time.  

This time, I'm gunning for it again (that's the easy part) and plan on figuring out the maintenance aspects.  

There are some extreme experimental protocols that I've used in the past to trigger it..., but I'll be charting out a map this time, rather than chancing upon it.  

All this sounds pseudosciencey but I guess I'm just the right mixture of irrational and ambitious to risk it.  

Regular writing is one of the activities that helped me hone on with intent during such phases and you may expect more such microessays regarding the same, concerning the finer details of the branches of my being that I choose to exploit this time.  

### Post Script:

I'm glad I'm choosing to describe that state of being in an elaborate manner and [not creating a new word for it.](https://github.com/rajp152k/19-22_archive/blob/master/_pages/dictionary.md)  

This helps me not to hallucinate under the facade of creating all-encompassing words..
