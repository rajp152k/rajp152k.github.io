As of [today](https://github.com/rajp152k/buffer/commit/ab67e8281cd4159077d4524e13c57c1d3a6623c8#diff-8b236f169972d04a6ef8a362fb84d1e2654e1ff5d347267fd78cfb10d904f0d5), am decommissioning my org roam notes builds : there used to be a notes section in banner above.  

The current UI is not apt anymore for the scale of nodes accumulated - build times are high (2+ mins) and the navigation capabilities are archaic : will engineer and publish another navigation experience soon. Will continue publishing my notes to the [repository](https://github.com/rajp152k/buffer) as usual.
