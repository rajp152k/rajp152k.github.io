Emacs has been a trustworthy companion of mine for around 4+ years now. We've shared some highs and lows. I owe a major fraction of whatever conceptual depth I maintain in computer science to messing around with my tools.  

Emacs is also the core of my first [major youtube breakthrough](https://youtu.be/UwfYn9lTm74).  

I haven't yet explored the emacs niche completely and will be investing more time into honing my repertoire and understanding what sort of mindset the tooling expects from you rather than just fitting emacs into my thoughts.  

From a content creation perspective, I do find the act of spreading the word to be a noble pursuit (emacs also seems to be in demand btw).  

As of now my journey with emacs is just beginning and I still feel the same amount of enthusiasm I first approached in the summer of 2020.
