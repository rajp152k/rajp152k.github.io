I partition my days in phases of different mindsets that allow me to
cater to my varying epistemological hungers. One of them is a daily
ninety minute ideation hunt and feast that helps keep my skills sharp.  

The laws of thermodynamics do form a formidable devil that really does
mess up your ordered habits if you do not inject in the necessary
energy from time to time.[^1]  

As a way to sharpen the intellectual axe, I envision
myself going on domain hunts to allot myself a new class of game to
look forward to during minor breaks from my usual, comparatively
conventional endeavors.  

Variation in what you eat builds robustness and allows you to not fall
prey to the periodic fluctuations in the interest ecosystems of your
mind. Failure to do so might result in alternating times of excess and
scarceness, thereby limiting your extent of control over your
tendencies in the moment.  

I'd prefer equanimity over a roller-coaster in the long term: for
adrenaline fades fast, but a sound purpose persists longer than the
waxes and wanes of disinterest and infatuations.  

Reading diversely and not depending on limited and specialized sources
of brain food does aid one to not throw a fit and when they
momentarily encounter the inevitable dip of boredom in a certain
domain.  

Life may just give you lemons, but it's up to you to
hunt for the berries and the bats.  

Once locked on a prey, I might have a month-long infatuation test for
that domain and if it survives, I add it to reliable sources from
which I can draw upon later when I need to fill in a gap in my
schedule.  

In cases of distaste, experience is experience, a null response is
another input, checked off, that doesn't tend to your sorts
of rewards.  

While one may antagonize me here by drawing upon the arrows of focus
and specialization : I personally do not view the core of domains to
be so disconnected that their mutual knowledge does not elevate the
collective comprehension - I perceive their tactical combination to be greater than the sum of their individual worths.
