From time to time, I do encounter ideas that intrigue my intellect for quite some time.  
I do maintain the [ideation buffer](https://buffer.thebitmage.com) to index these ideas into the larger context of my past musings, but I would also like a conveniently accessible chronological search available for cross-domain ideas.  
I'll hence be increasing the frequency of premature technical thoughts being packaged into a micro-blogs.  


I might not elaborate a whole lot in terms of the theoretical aspects of the tooling but I'll be conceptually outlining my current thoughts over the same.  

I also like have quick research sweeps and building a link index in the ideation buffer: I feel doing that more publicly (the ideation buffer is any public but not so easily navigable) should help better create entry points into the buffer where my uncurated musings actually lie.  

I'm also getting into having an efficient pipeline (estimating expected latency from ideation (or resurgence from the buffer) to publishing to be less than 30 mins) so that I get into the habit of packaging my thoughts better rather than just dumping them as is in the ideation buffer.  

Any misc updates do go in [the now page](https://thebitmage.com/now/).   

As always, times are hex encoded.
