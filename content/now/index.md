A [chronologically descending](https://buffer.rajpatil.dev/20230712132109-timestamps.html#ID-20230712T132110.496747) log of my "nows" : cause an "about" is
temporally impractical...

Entering a somewhat stable phase where in I'm
sustainably pushing on multiple aspects of how one may measure their
overall progress.  

Will be speaking and writing more succinctly than usual - in my blogs
and in the videos. Focusing on quieting my mind a little - too many
threads running around chaotically at an instance in time. That isn't
particularly a big deal (I do enjoy the pseudo-randomness that ensues)
but I'd like exploring expanding my control of the same.  

A lot of novel additions to my life over the past two years have
stabilized and am ready to take on the next set of habits and skills
to build upon the generic repertoire - I'm bored a little too quickly,
akin to a 4 year old - began piano lessons and getting into watching
MMA (will begin practicing in the next cycle of expansion).

I broke my Arch install a week ago and have shifted to Debian. The
base desktop env I used was KDE Plasma but shifted to i3-wm
immediately cause I don't like the mouse. There's just something very
interesting about connecting your headphones with bluetoothctl rather than
a GUI.

My Arch spell was shortlived but I did learn quite a lot, might try
void sometime soon but I still maintain a persistent installation of
arch on a USB that I carry wherever I go.

I'm setting up my new first-ever formal work-dedicated setup. Bought a
chromebox and will be installing vanilla Arch Linux. Emacs and Nyxt
will be my major workhorses. I might use notion if some collaborator
asks for it but version controlled org-files are my preferred way of
project management.  

Have been learning a lot about the minor details of a lot of
ubiquitous utilities that a techie uses but might not be aware of:
The chromebox boots up with coreboot and uses SeaBIOS and UEFI so
that's my first good introduction to open source firmware and
understanding how one really bricks a device by flashing stuff in
write-protected regions (curious, I am, but a cat, I ain't).  

I can sense a new time consuming hobby (ricing setups and whispering
"btw, I use Arch" into strangers' ears, sneaking up on them
in dark alleys, just like Batman would) that just might be suited for
the kind of person I am.

I'm ramping up the writing a little and lowering down on the
reads. That might not be good advice for an aspiring writer but I
wish to do more stuff for a while.  

I'm on a mild intellectual restriction so that I can adequately
assimilate all that I've read up until now.  

Do expect more works that aren't inherently inspired from existing
corpus but my own experiences and intellectual concoctions.

## 0x2132

As of now, I'm laying low and building myself up again. Life is
pretty boring and structured : workout, read, work, repeat... there's
not much to it worth discussing.  

From a work perspective, am an AI researcher at a cloud computing firm
and mostly deal with applications of AI/ML within the same -> am
able to study a lot and have some intellectual freedom given it's a
growing, modestly large firm and not a fully fledged corporate
experience.  

Don't have much of a social life and just getting used to
being an adult.  

I'm over the preachy phase of my life and have normal conversations
now - only when prompted for one. I get into philosophical discourses
only when prompted for one. People might say I'm a different person
now - not sure for better or worse. Sometimes stuff is just beyond
being good and bad (evil) -> it just is, what it is.
