A [chronologically descending](https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20230712132109-timestamps.html#ID-20230712T132110.496747) log of my "nows" : cause an "about" is
temporally impractical...  

## 0x239D

 - I hooked and ducked rapidly at the same time during a "light" boxing spar and dislocated my right shoulder around a month ago.
 - had two major ligament tears so had to get an arthroscopy and been a week since I've been able to type again comfortably
 - have to give the right a rest but strategizing rehab so I can get back to training again rapidly
 - 3 hours (morning road work + evening skill work + weights) of MMA training (was prepping and cutting weight for a fight) every day have been freed up for further investing on competence
 - will get back into training gradually post medical clearance : combat sports gave me a sense of stabilized high that powerlifting or bodybuilding couldn't - will chase that again ..

## 0x235B 
 - started MMA 
 - leaning out 
 - Focusing on Golang and the CNCF ecosystem towards open source

## 0x22C8 

 - writing technically and more often
 - getting into powerlifting
 - exploring emacs in depth

## 0x2292

 - Have rebranded my online presence as the (bit-mage). 
 - Given up on the old domain rajpatil.dev and ported all existence to thebitmage.com.
 - reading "Writing to Learn". will blog more technical and non technical than usual
 - might start maintaining daily bullet entries.
 - checking out ZygoMys soon (lisp in golang)
 - plan on writing an emacs extension
 - will start writing in different locations with the small laptop without monitor
 - considering giving up on the monitor: i.e. going the spartan way of working for a major porting of my workday
 - monitors seem to be over
 - teams screen sharing hasn't been working on wayland (might need to rebuild chromium with a webRTC flag and install pipewire 0.3 -> 0.2 compat patch : but things shouldn't be this tedious)
 - usually use sway, but had to momentarily switch to Gnome classic w/ Xorg today.
   - very painful
 - back on OMADs : going all in, on the fitness efforts : am ~26% BF right now, aiming for sub 20% this training block (12 weeks)
   - might restock on L-theanine. (haven't been dosing for quite a while now).
 - might start building a presence on reddit from a marketing perspective : the emacs video did gain traction on r/planetemacs
 - more microessays that aren't that curated henceforth : time to build a blog

Alright, feel like I've stabilized enough and am currently voluntarily 
injecting some more chaos into my life.

To put it lightly, I'm hungrier than usual (intelletually as well as
in the conventional sense).

With that being said, am naturally inclined towards being a man of
action than just of words this time around - I would usually elaborate but I
subconsciously refuse to do so due to reasons unbeknownst to my
conscious self.

Energy levels are at an all time high and anticipating a healthy cycle of
intense intellectual involvement across several domains over the
prolonged future - Feel like I'm entering a new personal era that I
can't really pin down the description of.

I changed my blog's tagline today, btw.


## 0x2203

Entering a somewhat stable phase where in I'm
sustainably pushing on multiple aspects of how one may measure their
overall progress.  

Will be speaking and writing more succinctly than usual - in my blogs
and in the videos. Focusing on quieting my mind a little - too many
threads running around chaotically at an instance in time. That isn't
particularly a big deal (I do enjoy the pseudo-randomness that ensues)
but I'd like exploring expanding my control of the same.  

A lot of novel additions to my life over the past two years have
stabilized and am ready to take on the next set of habits and skills
to build upon the generic repertoire - I'm bored a little too quickly,
akin to a 4 year old - began piano lessons and getting into watching
MMA (will begin practicing in the next cycle of expansion).

I broke my Arch install a week ago and have shifted to Debian. The
base desktop env I used was KDE Plasma but shifted to i3-wm
immediately cause I don't like the mouse. There's just something very
interesting about connecting your headphones with bluetoothctl rather than
a GUI.

My Arch spell was shortlived but I did learn quite a lot, might try
void sometime soon but I still maintain a persistent installation of
arch on a USB that I carry wherever I go.

## 0x21B2

I'm setting up my new first-ever formal work-dedicated setup. Bought a
chromebox and will be installing vanilla Arch Linux. Emacs and Nyxt
will be my major workhorses. I might use notion if some collaborator
asks for it but version controlled org-files are my preferred way of
project management.  

Have been learning a lot about the minor details of a lot of
ubiquitous utilities that a techie uses but might not be aware of:
The chromebox boots up with coreboot and uses SeaBIOS and UEFI so
that's my first good introduction to open source firmware and
understanding how one really bricks a device by flashing stuff in
write-protected regions (curious, I am, but a cat, I ain't).  

I can sense a new time consuming hobby (ricing setups and whispering
"btw, I use Arch" into strangers' ears, sneaking up on them
in dark alleys, just like Batman would) that just might be suited for
the kind of person I am.  

## 0x2196

I'm ramping up the writing a little and lowering down on the
reads. That might not be good advice for an aspiring writer but I
wish to do more stuff for a while.  

I'm on a mild intellectual restriction so that I can adequately
assimilate all that I've read up until now.  

Do expect more works that aren't inherently inspired from existing
corpus but my own experiences and intellectual concoctions.

## 0x2132

As of now, I'm laying low and building myself up again. Life is
pretty boring and structured : workout, read, work, repeat... there's
not much to it worth discussing.  

From a work perspective, am an AI researcher at a cloud computing firm
and mostly deal with applications of AI/ML within the same -> am
able to study a lot and have some intellectual freedom given it's a
growing, modestly large firm and not a fully fledged corporate
experience.  

Don't have much of a social life and just getting used to
being an adult.  

I'm over the preachy phase of my life and have normal conversations
now - only when prompted for one. I get into philosophical discourses
only when prompted for one. People might say I'm a different person
now - not sure for better or worse. Sometimes stuff is just beyond
being good and bad (evil) -> it just is, what it is.
