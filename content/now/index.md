A chronologically descending log of my "nows" : cause an "about" isn't enough.

##  0x2132

As of now, I'm laying low and building myself up again. Life is
pretty boring and structured : workout, read, work, repeat... there's
not much to it worth discussing.  

From a work perspective, am an AI researcher at a cloud computing firm
and mostly deal with applications of AI/ML within the same -> am
able to study a lot and have some intellectual freedom given it's a
growing, modestly large firm and not a fully fledged corporate
experience.  

Don't have much of a social life and just getting used to
being an adult.  

I'm over the preachy phase of my life and have normal conversations
now - only when prompted for one. I get into philosophical discourses
only when prompted for one. People might say I'm a different person
now - not sure for better or worse. Sometimes stuff is just beyond
being good and bad (evil) -> it just is, what it is.
