title: Now

A chronologically descending log of my "nows" : cause an "about" isn't enough.

I'm ramping up the writing a little and lowering down on the
reads. That might not be a good advice for an aspiring writer but I
wish to do more stuff for a while.  

I'm on a mild intellectual restriction so that I can adequately
assimilate all that I've read up until now.  

Do expect more works that aren't inherently inspired from existing
corpus but my own experiences and intellectual concoctions.

As of now, I'm laying low and building myself up again. Life is
pretty boring and structured : workout, read, work, repeat... there's
not much to it worth discussing.  

From a work perspective, am an AI researcher at a cloud computing firm
and mostly deal with applications of AI/ML within the same -> am
able to study a lot and have some intellectual freedom given it's a
growing, modestly large firm and not a fully fledged corporate
experience.  

Don't have much of a social life and just getting used to
being an adult.  

I'm over the preachy phase of my life and have normal conversations
now - only when prompted for one. I get into philosophical discourses
only when prompted for one. People might say I'm a different person
now - not sure for better or worse. Sometimes stuff is just beyond
being good and bad (evil) -> it just is, what it is.
