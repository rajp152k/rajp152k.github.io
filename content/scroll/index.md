## init

 - two lives  
    - maximalist (doom emacs, open suse tumbleweed, spilt keyboards, more, loc-lock)  
    - minimalist (termux, ssh, vps, vi, less, loc-free) (this)  
 - bullets   
 - zero config (almost) cli life  
    - UNIX philosophy  
    - spartanish  
    - EDC : phone, foldable keyboard, small notepad, ball point pen  
    - immutable reverse chronological streams (as usual)
