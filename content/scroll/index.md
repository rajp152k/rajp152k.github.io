```
- lix with nix-darwin over the weekend
- aidermacs watch mode good : actually pair programming 
- bitmage color spec all around (tmux, emacs, opencode)
  - really easy on the eyes
```

#### [ 0x24A6|1767859679 ] 

```
- set up a self hosted wakapi with wakatime-mode in emacs and opencode
- proceeding to programmatically orchestrate more of my life (finances, coms, health metrics, etc)
- the setup is fairly minimal as of now : nginx + n8n and wakapi 
  - slowly building up my appetite for self hosting
```

- archiving(unlisting) the "now"
- the scrolls replaces that 
- check "/now" for past entries
```

#### [ 0x2497|1766544851 ] 

```
- have multiple systems around me working at a time now
  (three, to be precise)
  - work on one, cognware on one, bit-mage and misc stuff on one
  - document all ideas in specific roam and GTD branches
- cognitively speaking : switching to a different ecosystem 
  feels better than moving around with my window manager 
  on the same machine
- lately thinking of breaking some self-imposed restrictions in terms
  of my ideation throughput
```

#### [ 0x2497|1766544781 ] 

```
- would enjoy repls as my de-facto interfaces for any 
  tooling/software I consume
```

#### [ 0x2495|1766369296 ] 

```
- moving out to distro-agnostic workflows 
- all I need is emacs, tmux, and a browser with certain binds
- then I'm immediately productive post stows
- considering keyboard native browsers rather than extensions
- Nyxt has been on my mind for a while now: might give it an actual shot 
  the next weekend
- hurdles involve lack of convenience extensions that are easily avaiable 
  for firefox/chromiums
- honestly, might just start using eww more and then firefox only when need 
  arises
- could also give the perplexity sonar APIs a good shot for usual operations
- need to meditate upon this
```

#### [ 0x2495|1766338272 ] 

```
- applied NeSy AI : is what I'm going after this season with resolve
- init indexing and reading papers, study groups and building a corpus
- excited

#### [ 0x248F|1765861531 ] 

```
- investing in clojure : good industrial span and lisp heritage : moving away from common lisp for a while : along the lines of the video : "lisp, but why." (been a while) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guEbzVuYzPc&t=5s&pp=0gcJCTwKAYcqIYzv
- Neurosymbolic is one of the more older interests of mine that stands at the hazy intersection of what's very enjoyable for me and somewhat valuable for the world
- augmenting and parsing my personal knowledge graph is something that I might explore shortly
```

#### [ 0x248B|1765510555 ] 

```
- increased usage of
  (zotero, browser, emacs(org, citar, roam)) 
  towards maintaining a corpus of papers
- infusing more curiousity driven reads 
```

#### [ 0x2488|1765275905 ] 

```
- moving from aider to opencode for agentic ops
```

#### [ 0x2487|1765117069 ] 

```
- taskfiles replace makefiles for library of shortcuts
- aidermacs augmented task collections good mix of control
  and flow
```

#### [ 0x2487|1765116862 ] 

```
- used to microblog quite a lot a while ago
- tech here neo-philosophy/cognition at cognware
- emacs buffers open at all times whenever I need
  to capture something
- monospace verbatim hence what I type (and what I see)
  is what you see
```
