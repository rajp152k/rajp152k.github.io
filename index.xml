- will be initializing a daily stream that I initialize every morning and end at the end of every day. - timestamps somehow increase my awareness of time and delegate the stress of time-management to the computer. - feels like a very simple productivity hack. - I borderline feel like Mark Watney from &amp;quot;Martian&amp;quot;.</description></item><item><title>The hex counter</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/hextime/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 19:55:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/hextime/</guid><description>0x1FFD I understand that society created the construct of time to facilitate collaboration and create accountable systems.
But&amp;hellip;,
it can be easy to lose a sense of your personal time as you continue working towards a particular goal. I do not like the idea of relying on alarms and calendars all the time to keep track of my progress all that I choose to pursue.
So&amp;hellip;,
I&amp;rsquo;m continuing a practice that I practiced for a short while during the last summer.</description></item><item><title>Sounding Smart is Easy</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/soundingsmarteasy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 09:22:43 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/soundingsmarteasy/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m personally vulnerable to coming off as a smart individual. Whenever people see me talk, they do think I&amp;rsquo;ve my priorities sorted out and know what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.
Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m just as confused as every other 22 year old out there trying to figure out where to channel all that ambition they harbor. A good anchor that helps me in carrying my present circumstances with me when I&amp;rsquo;m day dreaming is the habit of reading diverse content that varies across a huge time span(I don&amp;rsquo;t do fiction).</description></item><item><title>Symbols and customized cryptography</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/symbols/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 05:38:19 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/symbols/</guid><description>Cryptography, in the mathematical sense, is used in many domains but semiotics (the theory of symbols) is a more powerful personalized approach to encoding messages.
The mathematics bounds the subject to be used only via rigid analytical systems and not fluid malleable ones. I&amp;rsquo;ve found the latter to be more interesting in terms of application and what happens in the real world.
It can be as simple as creating a new domain specific language or reinterpreting old symbols via existing texts.</description></item><item><title>Informal Documentation</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/building-intellectual-bridges/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 17:13:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/building-intellectual-bridges/</guid><description>Over my past three years of maintaining a healthy intellectual appetite, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that I learn optimally in iterative cycles of consumption, consolidation and execution.
Expanding individually:
Consumption sweeping the current literature and the fundamentals you may even backtrack along recent ideas to find out the roots of the specific subject Consolidation you let the ideas that you&amp;rsquo;ve consumed simmer in your head this may lead to observing analogies, connections that weren&amp;rsquo;t explicitly consumed by you or seeing opportunities for improvement in existing ideas Execution Learning for its own sake is fun and all but results do matter and completing projects is when one actually learns about the abstract intricacies that are difficult to document.</description></item><item><title>Init</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/init/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 16:34:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/init/</guid><description>Incentives Precision I&amp;rsquo;m interesting in learning all that interests me in the moment. That usually results me in not being able to deliver for the sake of going under the hood and understanding the nature of the given problem.
Most practical problems do not have an end to the extent to which one can detail the model which they&amp;rsquo;ll use to solve it. It is a waste of energy and time.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hi, This is Raj:
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in everything that humans accumulate as knowledge (not current affairs) and generally do not think of subjects as discrete but subtrees of epistemology as the root.
Also a productivity enthusiast and I do go to extreme lengths to optimize personal workflows. I&amp;rsquo;m slowly tending towards the tradionally lazy but accidentally hyper-productive automator : for the sake of automation, we keep on tweaking our workflows till perfection (It pays off in the long run)</description></item><item><title>Résumé</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/resume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/resume/</guid><description>As of Thu Oct 6 07:50:21 AM IST 2022:
