Managing one&amp;rsquo;s intellectual appetite in these times of information (and noise) excess is quite an ordeal. Given superior tooling and methods to plough through dense knowledge forests, coming up with the right set of tools for oneself is still a commendable task.

From a work perspective, am an AI researcher at a cloud computing firm and mostly deal with applications of AI/ML within the same -&amp;gt; am able to study a lot and have some intellectual freedom given it&amp;rsquo;s a growing, modestly large firm and not a fully fledged corporate experience.</description></item><item><title>Résumé</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/resume/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/resume/</guid><description>As of Thu Oct 6 07:50:21 AM IST 2022:
