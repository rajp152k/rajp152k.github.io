I don&amp;rsquo;t like reading text books at a stretch due to several reasons:- &amp;ldquo;cross a bridge, when you get to it&amp;rdquo; is something that has stood the test of time for me when it comes to reading practical books.</description></item><item><title>Common Lisp : The Series - 0.1 : Representing Programs</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/clts/clts-0.1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 11:09:43 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/clts/clts-0.1/</guid><description>What makes lisp so unique is the way its code is structured - you definitely can&amp;rsquo;t miss all those parentheses. In this section of the series, I discuss the cause for such a representation and how that makes lisp unique in terms of how it views its code as data as code (aka homo-iconicity).

I&amp;rsquo;ll be summarizing the videos in these blogs and be using these to point to references and additional resources that further elaborate the matter.
This post is about why you should consider learning common lisp and how I intend to execute the plan of building an end to end resource index while simultaneously being able to learn more about the language myself.</description></item><item><title>RIP, Bram Moolenar</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/rip-bram-moolenar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 18:09:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/rip-bram-moolenar/</guid><description>In memory of the author of vim, arguably the most influential programming utility ever&amp;hellip;

The exercises aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a challenge but to adapt to the environment and the topics introduced. The book does not explore concepts with depth (CLOS, macros, etc&amp;hellip;) but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the objective of an introduction anyway.</description></item><item><title>PICC: pragmatics of intellectual consumption and creation</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/picc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 10:40:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/picc/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s a better way to do it - Find it.

Managing one&amp;rsquo;s intellectual appetite in these times of information (and noise) excess is quite an ordeal. Given superior tooling and methods to plough through dense knowledge forests, coming up with the right set of tools for oneself is still a commendable task. In this post, I sketch out how one could go about making such choices practically, from why you should bother, to what tangible actions you can get started with.</description></item><item><title>Here we go again...</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/writing-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 20:12:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/writing-setup/</guid><description>If you wish to be a writer, write.

A Brief History I took up writing as a hobby in the sophomore year of my bachelors and it turned out to be the most definitive step towards bettering my way with words and expressing myself accurately.
This is the fourth major iteration on my blogging system and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that I&amp;rsquo;m slowly tending towards minimalism and an overall clutter-free approach with each step, building up from my past stylistic mistakes and experiences.</description></item></channel></rss>
