&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re good to indicate a specific aspect of where you wish to affirm your competence in, but have exhibit numerous fallacies when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to optimize a probabilistic, unstructured, instinct based behaviour over longer spans of durations, ranging from weeks to decades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such a gauge is probably only exhaustively captured in how the complexities of life unroll around you based on your behaviours.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Personalized Science</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/personal-research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 11:14:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/personal-research/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like studying and exploring new things in the spirit of science. The science that happens today in institutions is more than just science and involves a lot of ancillary efforts directed towards the formalized production of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I respect formalized scientific efforts but feel like humanity as whole is losing out on the idea of having personalized problem statements to work on without worrying about applications, citations or what the next big thing is going to be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stuck on an Island</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/stuck-island/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 09:38:57 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/stuck-island/</guid><description>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s this saying :&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re stuck on an island and have the opportunity to build all of the software landscape again, the programming language you should choose is C. But the first thing you should write is a lisp interpreter.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a generalist at all times during your journey into polymathy. I mentally grasped this fairly recently that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to shun specializing for smaller durations.
Something like a day is obvious as a candidate but, in the past, I would shy away from even periods of a month to actually focus on a singular thing. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly comfortable doing that for upto three months now but would recommend touching a large span of domains over the span of six months for you don&amp;rsquo;t want to start losing out on the humility that interdisciplinary pursuits enforce on you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doom Emacs config'd for Python</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/doom-emacs-python/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2024 15:10:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/doom-emacs-python/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alter your doom block in init.el:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll give the people what they want: I get to enjoy esoteric tech and spread the word, growing a cult, while other humans have enlightened experiences (believe me I do talk like this in person) and continue propogating the techno-propaganda about enjoying computer science.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quick Musings</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/quickies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 20:24:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/quickies/</guid><description>&lt;p>From time to time, I do encounter ideas that intrigue my intellect for quite some time.&lt;br>

&lt;p>All of my pipelines are based around Linux and the core GNU utils. I had to use windows for a while due to org-wide constraints but I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been given the signal to shift to linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I rarely used any windows native tools for my workflows and there was always a layer of linux emulation/virtualization (wsl, scoop, and the likes) upon which I conducted my usual operations. Given I use Debian at home, a non native linux experience was frustrating at best and depressing at worst. No more, do I have to confine myself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IKN0X224C: Epistemological Polyglotism</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/linguistics-and-flow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 20:29:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/linguistics-and-flow/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>check out what an IKN0x means &lt;a href="https://thebitmage.com/post/ikn0x0/">here&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding different languages can open up one&amp;rsquo;s mind towards
different cultures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The evolution of languages over centuries and common ancestors
there-of over millenia indicates the evolution of cultural
complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-conventional-take">The Conventional Take&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I grew up actively conversing in 4 languages: English, Hindi,
Marathi and Gujrati. French was my first romance language I was
exposed to for over 8 years (I say exposed as was learning this
academically as a third language and didn&amp;rsquo;t use this as a &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;
language as much as the others).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Talking About What You Do</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/talking-about-what-you-do/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:30:36 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/talking-about-what-you-do/</guid><description>&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing quite as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to lately and have

elegantly implicit existence of symbolic algebra in several domains
that I personally explore on a regular basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That initial infatuation with Lisp ( and consequently symbolic
computation ) has simmered and fermented enough in my mind to be
realised as a potent generic thinking device. To cement my
commitment to the same, I&amp;rsquo;ll regularly dive deeper into relevant academia
so I don&amp;rsquo;t lose out on the joys of thinking for the sake of itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IKN0X2223: Epistemological Cartography</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/ikn0x2223/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 05:54:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/ikn0x2223/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>check out what an IKN0x means &lt;a href="https://thebitmage.com/post/ikn0x0/">here&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>3 hours ago, I encountered a semantic crisis. It all started with the
thought that I&amp;rsquo;m not really prepared for a lot of things in life. Now,
that in itself is a toxic thought - one can never be prepared for it
all but I definitely have time to figure out several things with
minimal extra effort. This would definitely result in a lot of
uncertainty being cared for. I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered the nihilistic
philosophy before: if complete certainty cannot be achieved, why try
clearing away any of the uncertainty you have around you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Polymathic Gamble</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/polymathy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 16:57:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/polymathy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do note that this is an old post (from my last archived blog) that I&amp;rsquo;m

&lt;p>I, hitherto, have been reading books as a single unit of intellectual
conveyance. However, that strategy doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for all the
works. Some authors have their writings crisply intertwined with
their other writings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Approaching a single book as a part of a larger intellectual
conveyance is more efficient in the longer term if one intends to read
all the work of a particular author. Consequently, grouping these
reads together has also been somewhat interesting lately.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Refactoring Old Works</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/refactoring-old-works/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 16:21:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/refactoring-old-works/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d managed to produce some fairly original essays on my last blog and

&lt;p>I use emacs for a lot of my daily tasks and spend majority of my time
in it. This is a review of some significant components of my init.el&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">;keyboard all the way&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>(tool-bar-mode &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">-1&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>(scroll-bar-mode &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">-1&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;hr>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">;I don&amp;#39;t like distractions&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>(setq byte-compile-warnings &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;#39;&lt;/span>(cl-functions))
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>(setq ring-bell-function &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;ignore&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>(setq visible-bell &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">t&lt;/span>)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I chose the most recently engineered package-management solution when I began with emacs, haven&amp;rsquo;t switched
since and don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll need to. Migrating from vim, I preferred a
configuration file rather than installations via melpa interface.
Also, freezing and thawing is cool : exact reproducibility is guaranteed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Common Lisp - A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/cl-aitsc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 17:51:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/cl-aitsc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Given I&amp;rsquo;ve passed through SICP once, quickly grasping common
lisp to build stuff and explore the
traditional and industrial aspects of lisp (I know clojure exists but
traditional&amp;hellip;) was my next objective: with decent speed and only
solving the somewhat involved exercises, it took me two weeks to
complete this book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exercises aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a challenge but to adapt to the
environment and the topics introduced. The book does not explore
concepts with depth (CLOS, macros, etc&amp;hellip;) but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the
objective of an introduction anyway.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PICC: pragmatics of intellectual consumption and creation</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/picc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 10:40:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/picc/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;em>Thomas Alva Edison&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Managing one&amp;rsquo;s intellectual appetite in these times of information
(and noise) excess is quite an ordeal. Given superior
tooling and methods to plough through dense
knowledge forests, coming up with the right set of tools for
oneself is still a commendable task. In this post, I sketch out
how one could go about making such choices practically, from why you
should bother, to what tangible actions you can get started with.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Here we go again...</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/writing-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 20:12:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/writing-setup/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>I took up writing as a hobby in the sophomore year of my bachelors and
it turned out to be the most definitive step towards bettering my way
with words and expressing myself accurately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the fourth major iteration on my blogging system and I&amp;rsquo;ve
noticed that I&amp;rsquo;m slowly tending towards minimalism and an overall
clutter-free approach with each step, building up from my past
stylistic mistakes and experiences. As with any beginner, I began with
enthusiasm and held my ideas in high regard - a major reason for why I
felt they should be out there. Over time, as I read more, I
learned I had a lot more to learn and finally after a long break of
writing frequently, here I am again, at symbolic ground zero -
drafting a first post.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
