&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://cognware.com">CognWare Industries&lt;/a> was established on the 1st of May to philosophically channel my cognitive energies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Explicitly addressing them allows me to separate out my identities of being technicality oriented (in here) and being too abstract (given the lisp aficionado that I am).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, a fusion of being overtly-abstract and over-engineering my thoughts are fundamental to my operations and my personalit(y/ies).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Decommissioning Roam Builds</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/decommissioning-roam-builds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:31:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/decommissioning-roam-builds/</guid><description>&lt;p>As of &lt;a href="https://github.com/rajp152k/buffer/commit/ab67e8281cd4159077d4524e13c57c1d3a6623c8#diff-8b236f169972d04a6ef8a362fb84d1e2654e1ff5d347267fd78cfb10d904f0d5">today&lt;/a>, am decommissioning my org roam notes builds : there used to be a notes section in the banner above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The current UI is not apt anymore for the scale of nodes accumulated - build times are high (2+ mins) and the navigation capabilities are archaic : will engineer and publish another navigation experience soon. Will continue publishing my notes to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rajp152k/buffer">repository&lt;/a> as usual.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Achievements</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/achievements/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 06:12:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/achievements/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have a somewhat indifferent approach towards achievements(mine and others&amp;rsquo;): with tendencies to gauge the personalities based on how their conversations flow and in terms of the quality of the questions and problems they are working on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve began to grasp why they actually might be a necessary construct:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>when leading larger societal initiatives, simply claiming ethical superiority doesn&amp;rsquo;t pan out well (and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t) with the need to gain the trust of masses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you need displays of competence for people to will their incentives to align with yours somehow (necessary for collective progress).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>claiming dignity is simply not enough and that is a good thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>of course, this opens up a whole bunch of societal games and dynamics that are too complicated for me to completely break down right now.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you do wish to make a change, you will someday have to take the helm of larger groups of humans. This is when being competent and having proofs for it becomes indispensible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm in the Business of Ideation</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/gaming-youtube/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 09:01:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/gaming-youtube/</guid><description>&lt;p>People have been responding to emacs and my beard.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For a while I thought I did not have a lot to say. Turns out a lot of other humans are quite interested in the much of the same things that I&amp;rsquo;m into: my hatred for the mouse, and the consequent love for efficient workflows being some of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll give the people what they want: I get to enjoy esoteric tech and spread the word, growing a cult, while other humans have enlightened experiences (believe me I do talk like this in person) and continue propogating the techno-propaganda about enjoying computer science.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I turned 0x2222 today</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/0x2222/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 19:09:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/0x2222/</guid><description>&lt;p>Currently, I prefer tracking the temporal increments of my existence
(&amp;ldquo;age&amp;rdquo; is what normal humans would say this means) via &lt;a href="https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20230712132109-timestamps.html#ID-20230712T132110.496747">hex
timestamps&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years ago, I kept track of my age in years and months like
normal humans do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I maintain the habit of analysing my mindset every major temporal
mileston in my life - when I turned 10 (I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember
exactly how I felt then) or 20, for instance, in accordance with the
widely accepted gregorian calendar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Consumption Update</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/consumption-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:49:03 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/consumption-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two days ago I found myself scrolling mindlessly for half an hour and
I decided I need to decide for real as to how I&amp;rsquo;m going to deal with
this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with such a habit is that it is very convenient, engaging
and it slices into precious time that I&amp;rsquo;d rather spend doing something
more difficult and rewarding like reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While devising a strategy to deal with this behaviour, I concluded
that videos themselves (long and short form) are the culprit to these
new time sinks that I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
