Years ago, I kept track of my age in years and months like normal humans do.
I maintain the habit of analysing my mindset every major temporal mileston in my life - when I turned 10 (I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember exactly how I felt then) or 20, for instance, in accordance with the widely accepted gregorian calendar.</description></item><item><title>Consumption Update</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/consumption-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:49:03 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/consumption-update/</guid><description>Two days ago I found myself scrolling mindlessly for half an hour and I decided I need to decide for real as to how I&amp;rsquo;m going to deal with this issue.
The problem with such a habit is that it is very convenient, engaging and it slices into precious time that I&amp;rsquo;d rather spend doing something more difficult and rewarding like reading.
While devising a strategy to deal with this behaviour, I concluded that videos themselves (long and short form) are the culprit to these new time sinks that I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing.</description></item></channel></rss>
