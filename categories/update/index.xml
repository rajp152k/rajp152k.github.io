&lt;p>For a while I thought I did not have a lot to say. Turns out a lot of other humans are quite interested in the much of the same things that I&amp;rsquo;m into: my hatred for the mouse, and the consequent love for efficient workflows being some of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll give the people what they want: I get to enjoy esoteric tech and spread the word, growing a cult, while other humans have enlightened experiences (believe me I do talk like this in person) and continue propogating the techno-propaganda about enjoying computer science.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I turned 0x2222 today</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/0x2222/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 19:09:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/0x2222/</guid><description>&lt;p>Currently, I prefer tracking the temporal increments of my existence
(&amp;ldquo;age&amp;rdquo; is what normal humans would say this means) via &lt;a href="https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20230712132109-timestamps.html#ID-20230712T132110.496747">hex
timestamps&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years ago, I kept track of my age in years and months like
normal humans do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I maintain the habit of analysing my mindset every major temporal
mileston in my life - when I turned 10 (I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember
exactly how I felt then) or 20, for instance, in accordance with the
widely accepted gregorian calendar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Consumption Update</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/consumption-update/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:49:03 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/consumption-update/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two days ago I found myself scrolling mindlessly for half an hour and
I decided I need to decide for real as to how I&amp;rsquo;m going to deal with
this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with such a habit is that it is very convenient, engaging
and it slices into precious time that I&amp;rsquo;d rather spend doing something
more difficult and rewarding like reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While devising a strategy to deal with this behaviour, I concluded
that videos themselves (long and short form) are the culprit to these
new time sinks that I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
