&lt;p>I was initially reluctant on using generative AI for my writing
process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I was quite aware of the potential of large language
models (generically addressed as LLMs in here henceforth) -
especially true in the case of content creators and/or eccentrically
curious individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I, therefore, decided to clarify how I&amp;rsquo;ll be using generative AI for
my ideation process.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Managing one&amp;rsquo;s intellectual appetite in these times of information
(and noise) excess is quite an ordeal. Given superior
tooling and methods to plough through dense
knowledge forests, coming up with the right set of tools for
oneself is still a commendable task. In this post, I sketch out
how one could go about making such choices practically, from why you
should bother, to what tangible actions you can get started with.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
