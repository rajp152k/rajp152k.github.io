&lt;p>Understanding different languages can open up one&amp;rsquo;s mind towards
different cultures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The evolution of languages over centuries and common ancestors
there-of over millenia indicates the evolution of cultural
complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-conventional-take">The Conventional Take&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I grew up actively conversing in 4 languages: English, Hindi,
Marathi and Gujrati. French was my first romance language I was
exposed to for over 8 years (I say exposed as was learning this
academically as a third language and didn&amp;rsquo;t use this as a &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;
language as much as the others).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IKN0X2223: Epistemological Cartography</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/ikn0x2223/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 05:54:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/ikn0x2223/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>check out what an IKN0x means &lt;a href="https://thebitmage.com/post/ikn0x0/">here&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Snap-shotting projections of the mind over time is a good habit
that you should practice.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try my best to persuade you of that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An over-powered upside to pursuing multiple interests
over the span of your life is to have the ability to compare and
contrast multiple domains, akin to having multiple hill forts over
your territory than only establishing a centralized castle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understand Reality and Imparting Meaning</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/understand-v-impart/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 17:39:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/understand-v-impart/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been formally delving into epistemology and relevant lateral root
domains recently and have been re-encountering several ideas that I&amp;rsquo;d
previously casually explored with intrinsic motivation.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t my first accidental implicit intersection of thoughts with
core philosophical theories like constructivist epistemology and
ontology.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given my natural inclinations towards personal interdisciplinary
research, apart from my core specializations, I do deliberately maintain an
extensive scaffolding around several domains that I plan to build
foundations in soon. This allows me to generalize over multiple
realizations of similar concepts in different epistemological clusters
and identify some interesting patterns.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
