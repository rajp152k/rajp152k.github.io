&lt;p>I got into the practice of logging updates in reverse chronological streams from one of my professors in my sophomore year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I began personalized hex timestamps (today is 0x2360 for me) because I don&amp;rsquo;t intuitively gel well with the (Julian -&amp;gt; Gregorian) cycles. The combination of lunar, solar and planetary cycles is my most recent experimental initiative for calibrating long term efforts but that would be a little too chaotic for the part of the world wide web that I mostly interact with these days.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Personalized Science</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/personal-research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 11:14:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/personal-research/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like studying and exploring new things in the spirit of science. The science that happens today in institutions is more than just science and involves a lot of ancillary efforts directed towards the formalized production of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I respect formalized scientific efforts but feel like humanity as whole is losing out on the idea of having personalized problem statements to work on without worrying about applications, citations or what the next big thing is going to be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solitude, Society, Originality</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/solitude-society-originality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 21:49:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/solitude-society-originality/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some-days, I wonder that I&amp;rsquo;m born half a millennia too late
into this world given the extent of novel societal tendencies that I&amp;rsquo;m
not fond of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although, the notion of Batman didn&amp;rsquo;t exist then, given a
choice, I&amp;rsquo;d probably consider time traveling to an intellectually simpler
life when much of what the present science and engineering entails was
just beginning to be discovered and invented.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Research options then weren&amp;rsquo;t thresholded by who&amp;rsquo;s packing heavier
compute but rather open to all that could observe patiently and
portrayed the will to ask, sceptic-ize and act according to their whims.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
