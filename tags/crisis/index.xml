&lt;p>3 hours ago, I encountered a semantic crisis. It all started with the
thought that I&amp;rsquo;m not really prepared for a lot of things in life. Now,
that in itself is a toxic thought - one can never be prepared for it
all but I definitely have time to figure out several things with
minimal extra effort. This would definitely result in a lot of
uncertainty being cared for. I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered the nihilistic
philosophy before: if complete certainty cannot be achieved, why try
clearing away any of the uncertainty you have around you.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
