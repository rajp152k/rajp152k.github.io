It&amp;rsquo;d been more a year since I graduated (majored in computer science and minored in artificial intelligence) and so I decided to brush up on some basics and consolidate what I&amp;rsquo;d studying since the past ~4 years.
I also picked up the book to systematically populate my org-roam buffer and have my root node rooted here in the braindump.</description></item><item><title>Prompt Crafting Distilled</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/dense-guide-prompt-engineering/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 16:38:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/dense-guide-prompt-engineering/</guid><description>The Premise I was initially reluctant on using generative AI for my writing process.
That being said, I was quite aware of the potential of large language models (generically addressed as LLMs in here henceforth) - especially true in the case of content creators and/or eccentrically curious individuals.
