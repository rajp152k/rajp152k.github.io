diverse domain. It&amp;rsquo;d been more a year since I graduated (majored in
computer science and minored in artificial intelligence) and so I
decided to brush up on some basics and consolidate what I&amp;rsquo;d studying
since the past ~4 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also picked up the book to systematically populate my org-roam
buffer and have my root node rooted &lt;a href="https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20230911114632-the100pagemlbook.html">here in the

&lt;p>I was initially reluctant on using generative AI for my writing
process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I was quite aware of the potential of large language
models (generically addressed as LLMs in here henceforth) -
especially true in the case of content creators and/or eccentrically
curious individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I, therefore, decided to clarify how I&amp;rsquo;ll be using generative AI for
my ideation process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-promise">The Promise&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before we get onto that, as promised by the title, distilling the
over-arching skills needed to extract good insights from a
conversation with an LLM (an el-el-em; please don&amp;rsquo;t read it as large, please..).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I have a Writing Tutor now ...</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/better-writer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:30:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/better-writer/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a &lt;a href="https://buffer.thebitmage.com/sitemap?stack=%2F20230920144401-prompt_engineering.html">book on prompt engineering&lt;/a> and decided to
practice a little&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a conversation I had with chatGPT regarding a small essay I
wrote recently and fortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s room to improve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Raj: You are my writing critic for this session; do not make any intellectual changes in any text I paste; do not heavily influence my style; only analyze what I say and generate pointers as to how I can become a better writer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Practical Natural Language Processing : Chapters 1-5</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/practical-nlp-c1-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 16:32:06 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/practical-nlp-c1-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>I took this up when I had to setup a bunch of NLP pipelines for work and
this does stand true to its name - it is a quick and practical index
into approaches, introductory theory and useful libraries for the
same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t like reading text books at a stretch due to several reasons:-
&amp;ldquo;cross a bridge, when you get to it&amp;rdquo; is something that has stood the
test of time for me when it comes to reading practical books. I don&amp;rsquo;t
find it useful to read stuff without the doing if that is what the
book is intended for.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
