&lt;p&gt;Although my days are scheduled along with a mostly invariable undercurrent of overarching directives, a deliberate portion of &amp;ldquo;something new&amp;rdquo; keeps me engaged and aware in the longer run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of needing &amp;ldquo;something new&amp;rdquo; everyday has become the most recent constant in my life: to the point of me considering adopting a &amp;ldquo;new new&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;nothing new for a while and seeing how that feels&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Talking About What You Do</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/talking-about-what-you-do/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 19:30:36 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/talking-about-what-you-do/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing quite as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like to lately and have
been considering how I approach the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of talking about what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking in the moment (pretty
fleeting), I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the point where I&amp;rsquo;ll go &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m planning on &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; : I do
not wish like doing that anymore. Talking about my momentary plans for
a while has been quite the distraction that I occasionally enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hunt, Feast, Repeat</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/hunt-feast-repeat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 09:05:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/hunt-feast-repeat/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I partition my days in phases of different mindsets that allow me to
cater to my varying epistemological hungers. One of them is a daily
ninety minute ideation hunt and feast that helps keep my skills sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laws of thermodynamics do form a formidable devil that really does
mess up your ordered habits if you do not inject in the necessary
energy from time to time.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way to sharpen the intellectual axe, I envision
myself going on domain hunts to allot myself a new class of game to
look forward to during minor breaks from my usual, comparatively
conventional endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
