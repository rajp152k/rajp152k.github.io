been considering how I approach the whole thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of talking about what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking in the moment (pretty

&lt;p>As a way to sharpen the intellectual axe, I envision
myself going on domain hunts to allot myself a new class of game to
look forward to during minor breaks from my usual, comparatively
conventional endeavors.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
