`,content:` This video explores a productivity workflow in Emacs that leverages window opacity, moving it beyond a purely aesthetic feature. The creator demonstrates how a translucent Emacs frame can be used as an overlay to view and control background applications, improving efficiency and saving screen real estate.
The Concept of Functional Opacity [00:00:12] The creator initially viewed opacity as just for aesthetics but accidentally discovered a practical use case. [00:01:46] The core idea is to decouple focus from control. The user can remain focused within Emacs while their controls are passed through to a background application. [00:02:09] To achieve this, granular opacity controls have been set up with convenient key bindings, allowing for interactive adjustments or quick toggling between preset levels (e.g., low, medium, high). Practical Demonstration: Emacs and Org-roam UI [00:02:58] The primary use case shown is with Org-roam notes. The Emacs window is made translucent, revealing the Org-roam UI graph visualization running in a Chromium browser window behind it. [00:03:55] Thanks to Org-roam UI&rsquo;s &ldquo;follow mode,&rdquo; which uses WebSockets, the creator can navigate their notes in Emacs, and the graph in the background browser automatically updates to follow their position. [00:04:25] All control over the background graph (e.g., switching from a local to a global view) is done from within Emacs using key bindings, eliminating the need to alt-tab or switch windows. [00:06:51] This method improves productivity by allowing the user to view related visual information (the graph) while working on text (the notes) in the same screen space, without splitting windows or using multiple monitors. Expanding the Idea: Decoupling Focus and Control [00:05:32] The creator notes that the current Org-roam setup is tightly coupled. The long-term vision is for a more generic system. [00:05:54] The ideal setup would be a general &ldquo;bypass&rdquo; mode where controls from Emacs could be sent to any background application (e.g., scrolling a webpage in Firefox) while the user remains in their editor. [00:06:34] This concept might require development at the window manager or compositor level to properly manage which application receives input, regardless of which one is visually in focus. Related Personalizations and Future Ideas [00:08:41] The creator mentions purchasing split foot pedals to add more input methods without causing repetitive strain injury (&ldquo;ankle RSI&rdquo;). [00:09:28] There&rsquo;s an interest in exploring Emacs Live and Overtone, a musical synthesizer, to create music based on keystrokes and chords while typing. Conclusion [00:10:11] The video serves as a demonstration of the creator&rsquo;s evolving philosophy on user interfaces. The goal is to find more efficient, productive, and fun ways to interact with the computer. By reimagining a simple feature like opacity, a novel workflow emerges that saves time and screen space, representing an emergent pattern from years of &ldquo;messing around&rdquo; with system configurations.

`,content:` This video is the second part (0x1) of a series on writing an operating system. The creator, Raj, details the comprehensive studying and logging strategy he has designed to tackle this long-term project. The goal is to create a structured approach that fosters deep understanding, maintains motivation, and effectively manages the vast scope of the endeavor.
Introduction and Motivation [00:00:10] Raj introduces the topic: the &ldquo;studying and logging strat&rdquo; for his OS project, emphasizing the need for proper preparation and a &ldquo;generic compass&rdquo; for a long journey. [00:03:00] He frames writing an OS as a problem that requires true understanding, unlike tasks that can be &ldquo;handwaved&rdquo; with AI. This project serves as a personal answer to the question of how to genuinely study complex topics today. [00:05:00] The project is approached as a fun, challenging hobby, with the goal of building a formal, well-documented effort to avoid fizzling out. Core Logging and Study Strategy [00:07:30] Daily Journaling: Raj uses org-journal in Emacs to log his daily thoughts, questions, and what he&rsquo;s learning. He dedicates approximately 15 hours per week to the project. [00:09:40] &ldquo;Meditations&rdquo; Log: A separate, long-term log is used to capture larger, open-ended questions about systems design, research, and learning strategies. This allows complex ideas to &ldquo;simmer&rdquo; over time. [00:15:30] Fundamental Learning: His primary learning resource is the textbook Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP). He is working through it systematically. [00:17:50] Hands-on C Practice: To rebuild his C programming skills, he is actively coding the examples from OSTEP, tinkering with the source code, and pushing it to a Git repository. [00:20:45] Starting with C: He explains his decision to start with C is to first deeply understand why it is the standard for OS development (e.g., POSIX, memory control, hardware interaction) before he can logically consider alternatives. Advanced Learning with Emacs and AI [00:26:00] Knowledge Graph with Org-roam: He uses Org-roam not as a static knowledge base, but as a &ldquo;wisdom generator&rdquo; to build and visualize connections between concepts. He demonstrates a workflow where he makes his Emacs window transparent to view his knowledge graph in the background. [00:27:50] AI-Generated Outlines: Using the gptel package in Emacs, he sends topics to an LLM to generate concise, jargon-heavy outlines. This helps him quickly identify key areas and create links to other nodes in his knowledge graph. [00:30:15] AI as an Expert Mentor: He uses another tool, aidermacs, with a custom &ldquo;Unix graybeard&rdquo; persona. This enables a conversational Q&amp;A format for exploring deep systems programming questions, which has helped him &ldquo;rediscover&rdquo; concepts like tickless kernels. Tooling and Resources [00:12:40] Virtualization: He plans to use KVM and Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) to automate his testing pipeline. [00:36:20] Emacs as the Hub: Emacs is the central tool for his entire workflow—managing journals, reading PDFs, writing code, interacting with LLMs, and accessing man pages. [00:39:50] Supplemental Books: He intends to read other books like Modern C and Hacking: The Art of Exploitation to broaden his knowledge in related areas like security. Conclusion [00:41:00] Raj concludes that even after a short time, this structured approach has already produced a positive mindset shift and increased his feelings of competence. [00:41:40] He assures his audience, many of whom are Emacs users, that Emacs will remain central to the series, serving as a powerful tool that becomes an &ldquo;extension of your body&rdquo; in the &ldquo;war&rdquo; of building an OS. `,url:"https://rajp152k.github.io/post/osdev/0x1/"},"https://rajp152k.github.io/post/osdev/0x0/":{title:"OSDev[0x0]: Writing an Operating System",tags:["osdev","c","emacs","vim","unix","linux","education","systems programming","study","logs","youtube"],meta:`<article class="list__item post">

`,content:` This video serves as an announcement and introduction to a new, long-term project: Operating System Development (OSDev). The creator, Raj, explains his motivations for taking on this formidable challenge, his plan for documenting the journey, and the tools he intends to use.
Why OSDev? The Motivation for a New Challenge [00:00:15] Raj explains he&rsquo;s been feeling bored with typical software engineering projects, which often feel too easy, especially with the rise of powerful LLMs. [00:01:21] He was seeking a &ldquo;formidable project&rdquo; that would genuinely challenge him and couldn&rsquo;t be easily solved by an AI tool. [00:03:00] A primary driver is a personal quest to feel competent. He believes that successfully building an operating system will cement his confidence as an engineer. [00:04:36] He wants to move beyond being a &ldquo;hand-wavish&rdquo; software engineer and gain a deep, fundamental understanding of the systems he uses daily, such as systemd. [00:05:43] The project also serves as an opportunity to get back into reading textbooks and explore &ldquo;old-school&rdquo; computing concepts, which he enjoys. Project Plan and Documentation [00:02:40] The video series will be unstructured, presented as work logs and journals rather than polished tutorials. He compares the process to exploring an &ldquo;open-world RPG.&rdquo; [00:02:47] His entire journey, including notes and logs, will be version-controlled and publicly available in a GitHub repository. [00:10:48] He plans for a continuous, podcast-style format with at least one video per week (Saturdays), supplemented by shorter, micro-video updates for milestones to maintain a tight feedback loop with his audience. Tooling and Workflow [00:06:21] Emacs will be the central hub for the project, used for coding, note-taking, journaling, and as an LLM client. [00:07:44] He will use Tmux for terminal management and work within an openSUSE Tumbleweed environment. [00:10:14] The project will involve programming in C and Assembly, which he sees as a return to the fundamentals of programming. Channel Direction and Future Goals [00:09:44] Raj wants to shift his channel&rsquo;s focus from showcasing tools in a &ldquo;glass case&rdquo; to demonstrating them in a real-world, complex application. [00:13:00] OSDev provides a natural, unforced use case to explore and evaluate different tools and programming philosophies. [00:11:15] He hopes the documented journey can serve as a guide for others who might want to start OSDev from scratch in the future. Conclusion Raj concludes by expressing his excitement for this new, challenging venture. He emphasizes that this project is as much for his personal growth and learning as it is for creating content. He plans to be much more regular with his uploads and invites viewers to follow along on this ambitious journey.

`,content:`I wrestle with boredom from time to time: probably because I maintain a healthy addiction for novelty.
Although my days are scheduled along with a mostly invariable undercurrent of overarching directives, a deliberate portion of &ldquo;something new&rdquo; keeps me engaged and aware in the longer run.
This idea of needing &ldquo;something new&rdquo; everyday has become the most recent constant in my life: to the point of me considering adopting a &ldquo;new new&rdquo; of &ldquo;nothing new for a while and seeing how that feels&rdquo;.
Imagine not doing anything new for a few days (four to be precise, ending two days ago) is the &ldquo;new new&rdquo; in one&rsquo;s life : how spoilt does one have to be for that to be a precondition for an experiment.
This does affect my operations, in several manners: the funkiest of them all is me explicitly spending thought on what can I do better when I do not have grounds to judge the outcomes of the last run yet.
All that I partake in (tangibles and the abstracts), in this certain mindset, is &ldquo;One off&rdquo;.
I need to change my need to need change to a somewhat more harmonic frequency.
I, however, do not completely denounce the benefits of maintaining such a state of mind: I&rsquo;m not aware enough, yet, to present them here to balance it all out.

I, implicitly, have gathered a certain corpus of incommunicable collation of engineering wisdom (/ overenginering foolery?), surfing the architectural and conceptual sections of docs in quite some well-known, mystical, ancient or infamous sections of the internet.

`,content:`I&rsquo;ve lately been thinking deeply about how I interact with my computing environments; when working, I&rsquo;ve a
- an unrooted snapdragon ARM Android with Termux and Tmux for ephemeral vimmin &amp; sshing around when on the move
- an Intel x86 FreeBSD home lab for some asynchronous compute that I don&rsquo;t need right away and some redundancy for my important files
- a personal ubuntu VPS with a couple of intel x86 vCPUs for my self hosting endeavours and overall context orchestration
- several compute clusters (avx enabled x86s, ARM, &ldquo;the propietary GPU driver guy on the street&rdquo; GPUs, &ldquo;the other open source GPU driver guy on the steet&rdquo; GPUs, k8s orchestrated production &amp; development playgrounds) for work
- an AMD x86 Tumbleweed with emacs as the daily driver where I actually &ldquo;work&rdquo; : this is desk where I dissect, analyse, reconstruct and dispatch for usage across the above
There has been this irk that I&rsquo;ve catched up on regarding my way of thinking with too much depth as to what is doing what. That&rsquo;s enjoyable and necessary in itself but I feel I&rsquo;m missing out on a more elegant perspective about this whole -&gt; sort of a lisp machine analogue for this personal compute network.
Feels like I&rsquo;m not completely exploiting the machines around me and there&rsquo;s a whole lot of creativity and raw cognitive power that I&rsquo;m missing out on.
I might need to meditate upon how I actually think about what I&rsquo;m actually doing.

`,content:`I&rsquo;m a Philosopher (etymologically speaking, I do love wisdom).
CognWare Industries was established on the 1st of May to philosophically channel my cognitive energies.
Explicitly addressing them allows me to separate out my identities of being technicality oriented (in here) and being too abstract (given the lisp aficionado that I am).
Of course, a fusion of being overtly-abstract and over-engineering my thoughts are fundamental to my operations and my personalit(y/ies).
Allocating dedicated sandboxes will allow them to get out of each other&rsquo;s way..
I&rsquo;ve begun splitting my personas and being more reflective as you may already observe..
As for the current observer that orchestrates the swarm of all of my splits (many go undocumented and are still unrealized), the DD0xes will hopefully serve as a favourable base of meta-programmatic head quarters..

The Information Manager from Hell

Thinking about compiling more such landmarks &ndash; an itinerary for fellow cyber pilgrims
Reviewing older codebases is an underrated exercise for software engineers
It&rsquo;s a journey through the evolution of code, revealing the engineering decisions that moulded what we deal with today
Tracing the history of a project – understanding what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and how technical components evolved – has been a joy lately
Grateful that we get to stand on the shoulders of giants and enjoy the intellectual sky line
I, however, would also like to periodically raid the basements, the bunkers, the dungeons, and hell, if you will &ndash; to grasp what structurally and temporally guided &ldquo;the infra&rdquo;

`,content:`I&rsquo;ve always maintained a philosophical appetite for the tooling that I use.
One of the core tenets of the Unix Philosophy1 is that everything is a file&hellip;
Plan92 has caught my eye due to its more homogenous design than the usual unix you&rsquo;re used to.
The footnoted-paper (~pre-mature book) is somewhat unhinged and doesn&rsquo;t shy away from taking a jab at the Unix ecosystem and design.
Apart from the several points the author makes, what stands out the most for me is the idea of everything truly being a file: in hindsight, Unix only realizes a fraction of the principle.
A year ago, I wouldn&rsquo;t have explicilty realized that Unix needed evolution, but I now understand there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of unrealized potential in this space.
I personally am interested in investigating virualization capabilities (can it replace a hypervisor for larger cloud workloads?) via Plan 9 but couldn&rsquo;t find explicit literature right away: a natural trajectory of engineering this from the already provisioned namespacing does arise.
I understand that this will not be production grade due to the philosophical and design differences between the underlying virtualizer (Plan9) and what the demand is rich for (the Unices), but this could potentially fork into a niche of distributed virtualization.
Will explore further for a while..

`,content:`I&rsquo;ve started spending some time per day without the usual modern software engineering tooling (LLMs, the Internet, etc) to explicitly maintain my cyber-deduction skills (in the context of Unix-based systems (BSDs, Linux, yet to explore Plan9), mostly because they power the majority of the global compute infrastructure).
It&rsquo;s fun: init your journey with a man man (I&rsquo;m an info info guy myself) and be extremely skeptical of your usual modus operandi, ditching all assumptions and tumbling down the rabbit hole.
Things really start picking up when you begin thinking about the neatly tucked away manipulation and conveyance of state, orchestrated by your operating system. I prefer breaking down any computing abstraction into interactions of three abstract systems rather than one of more theoretically foundational models (Turing machines (The RAM model) and Lambda Calculus (The Lisps) being the two I&rsquo;m aware of):
Processing(core and facilitative) Persistence (varying temporal granularity) Communications/Interfaces (internal and exposed) I would recommend you do not accept that categorization (also seen in the wild, more explicitly realized as Compute, Storage and Networking) right away and instead work towards your own understanding by observing and messing around.
This helped me understand hardware better and that each constituent (seemingly responsible for one1 specific task) of the parent abstraction can be further broken down into a combination of those three:
CPUs employ registers, caches and need to facilitate inter-core task orchestration NICs need buffers, protocol encoders/decoders to handle coms SSDs orchestrate concurrent IO, detect and repair corruptions, collaborate redundancy This is just one class2 of personal insights I&rsquo;ve developed by deliberately giving up on the &ldquo;superhero suits&rdquo; that are easily available to the usual software engineer today. Going down the local hood of your own computer will also help you understand the global distributed infrastructure as a unit (thank abstractual recursion again) with ease.
Eventually, I&rsquo;ve begun doing this intuitively for any &ldquo;novel&rdquo; computing abstraction that I encounter and have been grasping the crux faster than usual.
I might even be little ambitious and claim that this will help you not fall for a descartes&rsquo; fallacy3 and claim that the boundaries that we draw between hardware and software are fairly fluid.
I&rsquo;m trying to be familiar with the examples&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
I&rsquo;ve lately been tempted to apply parallels of this to organisms, organizations and the global network formed by their interactions as well but that is a highly experimental thought as of now. A more generic tooling (systems thinking) would be better suited but I like being capable of different tints to my shades based on the mood I&rsquo;m in.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

`,content:`Fabric1 is a collection of crowd-sourced prompts, exposed via a CLI tool. I used it for a while some time ago but never fully exploited it because I prefer Emacs.
Eshell buffers are an option, but I am principled in my tool usage and prefer to delegate longer-running CLI tasks to a combination of Alacritty and Tmux.
Maintaining my Emacs shell usage to ephemeral popups feels natural.
Gptel2 is a versatile LLM client that integrates smoothly into my workflow (buffer/text manipulation and management) without disrupting my thought flow.
I wanted Fabric&rsquo;s crowd-sourced prompts and patterns to be accessible via Gptel, so I wrote my first Emacs package: https://github.com/rajp152k/fabric-gpt.el.
I often write Elisp for configuration upkeep but needed to explore more to develop a package. I will refine it as new opportunities arise through usage experience.
Hitting spc i g f f launches an M-x style fuzzy complete for the pattern I want to work with, and an LLM request is dispatched with the context preceding the cursor in the current buffer.
It has made my life a little simpler.
Check out my .dotfiles for further insights into my Emacs configuration.

`,content:`For a while, I&rsquo;d limited my studying endeavours to be project oriented and not domain oriented. While I enjoy the pragmatism of the former, I also wish to build up my innate curiosity to get under the hood, disassemble the engine and be able to put it back together: no project (except the explicit choice of doing so) is going to help me fit that in my studies.
Consequently, I&rsquo;m planning on getting started with a regulary habit of exploring domains with depth.
Although I will not be able to allocate any payoffs in my career explicitly to any papers read in the moment, I am certain of the long term benefits towards my pursuit of competence.
I&rsquo;ll be directing my efforts towards understanding, dissecting and exploring harder problems in the larger scope of computer science.
The title serves as a mnemonic into the strategy I plan to employ:
rapidly index the literature under review and prepare for a deep pass heavily scrutinize and connect all dots and critically analyse loopholes and merits communicate/teach findings with relevant personnel, extract feedback, improve my understanding and iterate This is a step towards my long running desire of maintaining a personal research lab dedicated towards analysing an ambitious pool of problem statements to analyse with depth.

`,content:`From time to time, I like to make minor tweaks to my blog based on the treasure trinkets I find around in different corners of the internet from blogs/works of personalities I follow/find interesting.
I got into the practice of logging updates in reverse chronological streams from one of my professors in my sophomore year.
I began personalized hex timestamps (today is 0x2360 for me) because I don&rsquo;t intuitively gel well with the (Julian -&gt; Gregorian) cycles. The combination of lunar, solar and planetary cycles is my most recent experimental initiative for calibrating long term efforts but that would be a little too chaotic for the part of the world wide web that I mostly interact with these days.
Microessays are something that I converged upon to keep my writing endeavors regular. Large essays are good for consolidating noise-free signals through phases of your life but the duration&rsquo;s slightly long to account for the whimsical intellectual anomalies I&rsquo;d like to be captured.
I chanced upon the concept of the &ldquo;Now&rdquo; page (https://nownownow.com/about) from Derek Sivers blog.
I build my ideation buffer, node by node, from multiple minor and major ideas from books, blogs, existing open source knowledge graphs, some trial and error, and loads of intellectual fun..
I&rsquo;ve recently taken to building an index of interesting blogs (active, aggressive WIP) that I do check out from time to time when I&rsquo;m in the mood : I&rsquo;m not the regular RSS feed reading kind.
I&rsquo;m missing out on tons of great sources of inspiration so I decided to have a micro-essay, here onwards, whenever I find one worth integrating as a regular practice.
I liked the idea of having a PaperShelf from Arpit&rsquo;s blog.
I&rsquo;ve been a regular goodreads user and would enjoy something like that for papers. I&rsquo;ll be maintaining an index in my Papershelf henceforth as well..
I&rsquo;m starting out with the computer sciences but hope to read more holistically over the span of my life.

`,content:`One of my cousin&rsquo;s getting hitched and maneuvering your way through &ldquo;the great indian wedding&rdquo; while sticking to your nutritional routine is tough.
Not so much because you lack self control (that&rsquo;s the easy part and have that figured out) but more because all the relatives are out there stuffing delicacies down your throat at all times through a whole bunch of ceremonies (I don&rsquo;t have enough fingers to keep up with the count).
Denial backed by rationales like you&rsquo;re on a cut or that it doesn&rsquo;t fit your macros is not going to cut it.
Indian relatives can be very stubborn and what I&rsquo;ve found works is just declaring that I&rsquo;m diabetic: they don&rsquo;t force me any further.

`,content:`I have a somewhat indifferent approach towards achievements(mine and others&rsquo;): with tendencies to gauge the personalities based on how their conversations flow and in terms of the quality of the questions and problems they are working on.
Recently, I&rsquo;ve began to grasp why they actually might be a necessary construct:
when leading larger societal initiatives, simply claiming ethical superiority doesn&rsquo;t pan out well (and it shouldn&rsquo;t) with the need to gain the trust of masses. you need displays of competence for people to will their incentives to align with yours somehow (necessary for collective progress). claiming dignity is simply not enough and that is a good thing. of course, this opens up a whole bunch of societal games and dynamics that are too complicated for me to completely break down right now. If you do wish to make a change, you will someday have to take the helm of larger groups of humans. This is when being competent and having proofs for it becomes indispensible.
Although I find it a little saddening to chase tags and accolades explicitly, I do enjoy the idea of improving towards being the best, irrespective of the somewhat tangible recognitions.
This is again related to one of my other introspections that I rarely discuss:
if the actually competent start practicing ignorance towards the larger responsibilities in society.. the leadership positions would actually be occupied by personnel that optimize for attaining that title and not ones who are actually the most competent for carrying our the responsibilities pertaining to it. finally, these occupancies affect every ones&rsquo; existence and ignoring power just for the sake of being &ldquo;beyond such earthly notions&rdquo; is then, a more selfish act than chasing these titles, for the service to society is sub-optimal than it could have been if the actually competent chose to participate. Albeit, I still maintain an indifference towards others&rsquo; achievements while being critical on the lack of my competence proofs.

`,content:`check out what an IKN0x means here
ICBM, in here, is an abbreviation for the &ldquo;Intellectual Cluster Bootstrap Methodology&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;ve only recently began enjoying the joys of maintaining scaffolds in multiple intellectual domains.
Given you maintain good generic fundamentals of various root domains, you get to enjoy grasping new specific ones in an expedited manner.
These days when I have to assimilate a previously unseen domain, a weekend long pragmatic study marathon yields results comparable to what would&rsquo;ve required at least a week, before I deliberately chose to set out on this path.
Here are the crude aspects revolving around setting up the Launch.
Ingredients You need to take notes Never start with a blank page: you always know something, however trivial, about anything. Always capture whatever intrigues you. even if you don&rsquo;t consume it at that moment in time, enqueue it for latter reference. slowly grow your corpus of awareness, word by word and curate/consolidate branches into distilled nodes from time to time. Be shameless and upfront about how incorrect you could be Be unforgivingly meticulous with the miscellaneous details. more is always better than less, in the case of ingesting intellect, for you can always prune later down the line but will not be in the same state of mind again to inspire this certain thought you&rsquo;re wondering about storing. balance rigor and play: don&rsquo;t sacrifice either. Revisit your Notes Regularly I personally conduct weekly refactors and slowly chip away at the monster that I&rsquo;m building up Makes for a good intellectual hack-n-slash with some metal Read, a lot you need to maintain a baseline level of voraciousness and maintain a high reading over thinking ratio. spells of thinking without consuming will help with breakthroughs from time to time. but you sacrifice precious time if you don&rsquo;t do the homework, masked by the greed of publishing pseudo-original works. Everything goes. don&rsquo;t have to punish yourself for reading random stuff. Everything should go. do punish yourself for only reading with a unidimensional mindset. The Edge and the Node structure the Node around First Principles: this helps widen your grasp in unique manners so that you don&rsquo;t intern handicap clusters that just leech other root domains. you may have dependent projections, but don&rsquo;t claim them to be root. have several edges to capture connections between root clusters: this helps densen your grasp. The Eagle Eye Zoom out from time to time and observe. build domains dealing with &ldquo;domains&rdquo; in an abstract manner. this blog is an ICBM launch based on the notion of launching ICBMs. question your works, dissect your works, find flaws, appreciate your innocent efforts of the past, refactor with pride, and iterate. Day Dream be scary ambitious with your ideas and be aware that you&rsquo;re being stupid. The ICBM Now that you&rsquo;re used regularly indulging in the above delicacies individually, it&rsquo;s time to bring them all together and cook.
The Heat of Intent there is a time for play and a time for the mission mindset. intentfully choose to focus on particular objectives with deadlines. If you&rsquo;ve been maintaining the fertility of your mind with the habits above, the seeding thoughts growth will be accelerated with intent. Launch set off the ICBM, towards your target, and don&rsquo;t lose sight of what you sought out in the beginning. Surveillance You&rsquo;ll be tempted to fork your efforts into other domains along the way.. instead, capture the psuedo-seed for latter consumption. you&rsquo;re not sacrificing curiosity but taming it with discipline and allowing yourself to invoke it at will. but don&rsquo;t give up on the initial target until you get there. Explode &amp; Destroy Collect all your findings in your notes don&rsquo;t be afraid to archive existing domain clusters if you find them to be outdated setup links with all nodes that remotely resemble your current ideation state. Micro ICBMs launch minor campaigns if you seem to lack coverage. iterate until satisfaction. Claim your findings in a consolidated manner in summary nodes for quick skims latter down the line. publish them and share what you learned - accelerating the accumulation of collective intelligence. Let Yourself Cook Deliberately have phases where you let your clusters simmer and fuse and collide. Let entropy and evolution do their own thing and build a stronger, chaos resistant cluster civilization. Before you launch further major ICBMs cause you miss the chaos, let the dust settle all over, let the ripples dampen for the oceans to be clearer and then, Reflect. Build your Addiction Enjoy the fruits of your labor : you&rsquo;ve now assimilated a bleeeding and leading edge epistemological weapon to better understand the world around you.
Go on, conquer away..

`,content:`A while ago, I had the strong desire to partition some of my professional work logs into mutually exclusive git repositories: with Blacklists and Whitelists flipped.
I was aware that the .gitignore could ignore stuff; today I found out that I can also whitelist stuff via that.
checkout 1 this stackoverflow question
So if the first .gitignore looks like
asdf-pattern more-asdf some-absolute-asdf dir-asdf/ the second one would look like:
# blacklist everything first * # unignore the directories to capture nested existences !*/ # then your usual unignores !asdf-pattern !more-asdf !some-absoluete-asdf !dir-asdf/ What I wonder now is if git would allow for a branch-contextual .gitignore (named with certain protocols) so that I don&rsquo;t have to maintain two different repositories altogether.
Maybe I should consider creating a pull request sometime down the line&hellip;
The generic desire I take away from this is to have contextual gitignores.
The most voted answer was also built upon another stack overflow question: I like collaborative-augmentative intelligence.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

`,content:`I recently have moved on from using monitors and am working (professional and writing endeavours) only via a 13 inch laptop. It is definitely a different workflow than what I&rsquo;m used to.
It has been around 10 days I&rsquo;ve been doing this and here are some observations:
I&rsquo;m able to focus better as I&rsquo;m forced to enlarge my context maintaining capabilities; for I don&rsquo;t have the luxury to look back and forth with just my eye movements. I can work from anywhere. I change places and posture every 1.5 hours, 5 times a day. Given I move between a couple of meets during the day, I don&rsquo;t have to adjust to differing window management mannerisms as I only ever work on the same screen now. I work in at most two splits now compared to the 5+ previously: it is all simpler and the monitor has started to seem like a vanity rather than essential accessory. I don&rsquo;t have to switch keyboards between my desk and meets: I don&rsquo;t mess enough as much now. I can start looking down upon people that are bound to monitors, thinking that they&rsquo;re spoiled or aren&rsquo;t minimal enough. I&rsquo;ve started preaching about the spartan-ish effects of working only via your laptop I spend more time on screen, on my bed: consequently I&rsquo;m writing more. I definitely do miss reading papers and books on a larger vertically oriented screen but I&rsquo;m going to stick to this for a while.

`,content:`As an aspiring polymath, you&rsquo;ll soon run out of books and courses if you really wish to explore the intersection of multiple domains based on your current intellectual requirements.
That is a great problem to have and the solution is to transition into the mindset of chunking your learnings into projects rather than subjects.
I&rsquo;ll recommend maintaining a sense of pragmatism (incentivize application of what you&rsquo;re learning in the foreseeable future (with non-pedagogical intent)) and haste during your initial iterations. Perfection (The will to tend towards it, rather..) can follow once the prototype is principally sound.
You may expect to start and abandon a whole bunch of projects over the course of your life.
The one definitive thing that will help you maintain a sense of responsibility and mitigate the impending abstract dumping ground is to name your projects well.
I personally like to use references spanning across science fiction, mathematics, mythology, astronomy or whatever&rsquo;s been my muse recently. The more cryptic the better.
Do not use a vanilla name, it gets boring very quickly.
Atleast during the incubation, choosing something that enlivens your intellect, has been a successful variable (not completely independent as, if I&rsquo;m naming it, it must be confounding with my intent to follow through diligently) in dictating my will to work on it.
For instance, imagine creating an agentic AI that mentors humans in their journey towards learning to manipulate matter and energy in an immersive simulation, who would you rather choose:
Morpheus, or .. Agent Smith? I know which one I&rsquo;m going for.
Post Script A handy piece of advice: imagining being a supervillain helps cook up creative concoctions fairly rapidly.

`,content:`One cannot rely on objective standardized tests to gauge how good one is at the act of being.
They&rsquo;re good to indicate a specific aspect of where you wish to affirm your competence in, but have exhibit numerous fallacies when you&rsquo;re trying to optimize a probabilistic, unstructured, instinct based behaviour over longer spans of durations, ranging from weeks to decades.
Such a gauge is probably only exhaustively captured in how the complexities of life unroll around you based on your behaviours.
Albeit, there does seem to be an efficient approximation function for the aforementioned vaster objective that just might help you iterate faster in shorter temporal durations.
What&rsquo;s even more challenging is maintaining that feeling and staying in the goldilocks zone:
not too exhausted not too relaxed just right.., &ldquo;resonant&rdquo; rings just fine. I&rsquo;d like to think of it as a calm, but aggressive awareness of whatever you&rsquo;re participating in, in the moment. It allows the flexibility of accomodating your creatives sways, while pruning natural entropy&rsquo;s eventual effects.
This state of being that I describe, I&rsquo;ve gained and lost it a bunch of times over the past 5 years. I don&rsquo;t quite know the route to it. All I can ascertain about it is that, you don&rsquo;t experience it without investing some serious efforts (although finally, it all flows and feels effortless) but you do lose it if serious externalities consume too much of your time.
This time, I&rsquo;m gunning for it again (that&rsquo;s the easy part) and plan on figuring out the maintenance aspects.
There are some extreme experimental protocols that I&rsquo;ve used in the past to trigger it&hellip;, but I&rsquo;ll be charting out a map this time, rather than chancing upon it.
All this sounds pseudosciencey but I guess I&rsquo;m just the right mixture of irrational and ambitious to risk it.
Regular writing is one of the activities that helped me hone on with intent during such phases and you may expect more such microessays regarding the same, concerning the finer details of the branches of my being that I choose to exploit this time.
Post Script: I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m choosing to describe that state of being in an elaborate manner and not creating a new word for it.
This helps me not to hallucinate under the facade of creating all-encompassing words..

`,content:`I like studying and exploring new things in the spirit of science. The science that happens today in institutions is more than just science and involves a lot of ancillary efforts directed towards the formalized production of research.
I respect formalized scientific efforts but feel like humanity as whole is losing out on the idea of having personalized problem statements to work on without worrying about applications, citations or what the next big thing is going to be.
All those are definitely important.
But, the joy of conducting research sweeps without any intentions of publishing the findings or pressuring yourself into working on what you believe is worth working on leads to stifling your childish sense of curiosity and wonder.
I am interested in the full stack of computer science and although conventional performance indicators might suggest that targetting expertize in all of it at once is me being delusional, why shouldn&rsquo;t one consider drawing their own intellectual boundaries around domains.
I do invest with depth into what I do professionally but that isn&rsquo;t reason enough to sacrifice breadth into remoter areas of the root domain, especially if I like being an intellectual vagabond and noticing symbolic patterns spanning over vaster territories (is orthogonal to enjoying microscoping down molecules with rigor).
Rigor shouldn&rsquo;t be an excuse to entirely discard play is what I mean to convey.
How .. .. do you actually go about strolling randomly down divergent lanes of ideas?
I find it useful to not think of domains to have distinct boundaries between them but to be different facets of the same epistemological essence.
Just today, I explicitly realized (via a podcast) that enzymes could be interpreted as electronic breadboards, facilitating circuit assemblies, aiding electron transfers, producing newer molecules, ready to churn out the next set of transferences.
Despite knowing all those scientific components well individually (the chemistry and the physics of it), those 30 seconds yielded a &ldquo;hmmm&rdquo; from me that sparked me to write this post.
I&rsquo;m not going to be able to publish a paper on that or derive a seeding idea for a potential unicorn from that particular moment of intellectual deviance.
Still, I&rsquo;m more than okay with that and just might consider picking up a textbook on nanotech soon just so that I could learn more.
I might conduct some thought experiments, imagining manipulating molecules programatically in a fundamental manner, trying to abstract those into higher order constructs to build some sort of intelligent swarms that I could later use to take over the world by controlling neurotransmitters in humans&hellip;
All that is me hallucinating, having fun, being delusional and I know that&hellip;
I still choose to do it: I might not be able actually take over the world but I just might be able to have a couple of interesting weekends messing around with domains that are already well looked into and might just be able to find applications into what I&rsquo;m doing professionally while being childish about it.
Have a good time strolling about your own intellectually hallucinated landscapes and hope you return with fresh fodder to your main quests.

Prerequisites ALSA : https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture Functions single_beep() { ( \\speaker-test --frequency $1 --test sine )&amp; pid=$! \\sleep 0.\${2}s \\kill -9 $pid } morse(){ for i in {1..3}; do single_beep 400 $1 \\sleep 0.\${2}s done } sos() { morse 200 500 morse 400 500 morse 200 500 } timer() { \\sleep $1 &amp;&amp; sos &amp; } Usage The above can be sourced in your shell rc.
I store it in a .bash_funcs where I have all my functions and source them in the end of my rc as source ~/.bash_funcs.
timer &lt;seconds to sleep before the alarm&gt; Known Bugs If you happen to interrupt (C-c) a single_beep when it is in the sleeping stage, the sine test will not be killed and continue to ring.
In such a case ps aux | grep sleep | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 would save your soul.
PS: I would recommend you to let it ring.

`,content:`EDIT : 0x22D2 : Fri Sep 27 03:51:30 PM IST 2024 I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll proceed in common lisp do read on for amusement though As of 0x22CE (Mon Sep 23 06:48:40 AM IST 2024), These are the operating systems I&rsquo;ve used:
Open Suse TumbleWeed Fedora, CentOs, Rocky Debian, Ubuntu, Kali Arch Windows XP,Vista,7,10,11 I recently moved away from Fedora 40 to Tumbleweed (I deleted some core python libraries that are essential for yum and dnf (I know, I&rsquo;m an idiot))&hellip;
TumbleWeed has btrfs snapshots enabled by default and that convinced me to jump ship.
For a while before I settled on tumbleweed, I was in the distrohopper&rsquo;s psychic polylemma again (it&rsquo;s quite the mood).
Now I know, underneath, it&rsquo;s all the same (abstractions over your processor&rsquo;s instruction set), but I&rsquo;m somewhat of an abstract personality and do enjoy fretting over intellectual mirages.
So today morning (around 6 AM), for the hack value, I just thought of pairing together two antithetic technologies and writing my own operating system.
I&rsquo;ve had some good days (and nights) with Racket, so I thought I&rsquo;d go with it.
Do note that It&rsquo;s going to be like driving in a foggy eternity for a while and I&rsquo;ll have to backtrack from time to time..
But, along the way, I expect learning consiberably about sub-domains that I did not know existed.
From setting up a development environment to figuring out what all I&rsquo;m going to have to figure out, I hope to have a descent amount of fun while I&rsquo;m at it..
I&rsquo;m expecting this to be a stretched out hobby project, and am quite enthusiastic about the epistemological mine-fields that I&rsquo;m headed towards.
Do checkout https://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_Started
I will document the musings, thoughts, hallucinations and eurekas over on this blog and youtube as a series..
BTW, if the reason for me getting into this isn&rsquo;t clear, it&rsquo;s more along the lines of, &ldquo;Hmm, that would be cool &hellip;&rdquo;

`,content:`If you&rsquo;re new to the concept of polymathy (I personally ventured into the idea when I read Da Vinci&rsquo;s biography by Walter Isaacson), a lot of counter-intuitive traps await you when trying to build competence in multiple areas.
You don&rsquo;t need to be a generalist at all times during your journey into polymathy. I mentally grasped this fairly recently that you don&rsquo;t need to shun specializing for smaller durations. Something like a day is obvious as a candidate but, in the past, I would shy away from even periods of a month to actually focus on a singular thing. I&rsquo;m fairly comfortable doing that for upto three months now but would recommend touching a large span of domains over the span of six months for you don&rsquo;t want to start losing out on the humility that interdisciplinary pursuits enforce on you.
Now, not &ldquo;not eternally specializing&rdquo; in a domain is something that I&rsquo;m not a big fan of. With that being said, if you did studied everything, everyday, that would be detrimental to you in the sense that it limits the complexity of projects you can tackle.
Depth isn&rsquo;t evil, but lack of breadth is. Being an aspiring polymath, knowing the difference helps keep your pride in check when you do need to get specific in a particular domain.
I&rsquo;ve slowly made a mindset shift in appreciating my time off from other domains during such a phase as a fermentation period for all the raw materials that I&rsquo;d fed into my mind.

Activate the env your working on M-x conda-env-activate ... and can get on with the usuals ..
for more info checkout the local docs for :lang python (hit &lt;space&gt; h d m python &lt;CR&gt; and it should pop up) ..
If any jargon is too jargony, google a little and you should be fine.
The setup works great, would recommend using the repl here and an org-babel based literate programming setup instead of juptyer notebooks.

`,content:`People have been responding to emacs and my beard.
For a while I thought I did not have a lot to say. Turns out a lot of other humans are quite interested in the much of the same things that I&rsquo;m into: my hatred for the mouse, and the consequent love for efficient workflows being some of them.
I&rsquo;ll give the people what they want: I get to enjoy esoteric tech and spread the word, growing a cult, while other humans have enlightened experiences (believe me I do talk like this in person) and continue propogating the techno-propaganda about enjoying computer science.
As for really gaming the system, I&rsquo;m in it for creating good content and a great way to do that is get a lot of mediocre content and ideas out of your system (this is not me doing that, this is a good idea).
Other than the crux of your content, I believe the personality of the conveyer plays a big role in its perception. I, of course, plan on delivering well thought out (majority of the time) videos, but I&rsquo;ve lately been gradually unravelling more of my personality on the internet (an out-spoken live (low latency from ideation to speech) thinker that isn&rsquo;t ashamed of being wrong or too opinionated) and I find this to be more of an interesting side-quest (my main quest is not the subject of this blog) than creating content with a facade of formalities.
Of course, I don&rsquo;t want to waste your time when you choose to watch on of my videos (have been trying to make them denser and focused), but I also don&rsquo;t like chaining my flow of thoughts by establishing a script before I record. All I do is make rough outlines even I don&rsquo;t completely know what I have to talk about and let my brain do the rest of botching it up or elegantly crafting a polished idea : it&rsquo;s fun and I get to maintain a degree of authenticity and transparency.
In the process of building the cult of bit-mages and laying the doctrines, I would want the axioms to be as rational (or hysterically irrational that they&rsquo;re obviously sarcastic (you can&rsquo;t be sure of that)) as they need to be to be generically accepted.
An blog like this is a mechanism I&rsquo;m employing to leave the bread crumbs behind as my whims sway my mind between different points.
As of now I think:
it&rsquo;s good to capitalize on emacs from a content creation perspective all the time that I invest into it will actually be useful for someone other than me maintaining content quality is going to be fun challenge while building my personality along the way I do enjoy fame and money and all other side effects that being dedicated to a pursuit brings along with it, but &hellip; I&rsquo;m more into the idea of understanding computers for they truly are ingenious or stupid at the same time based on the algorithms that harness them I believe the world would be a better place if more people publicly talked about their esoteric interests for an esoteric community can creatively achieve more than an intellectually esoteric silo of a man. I&rsquo;ll be writing more like this, without inhibitions, henceforth.

`,content:`From time to time, I do encounter ideas that intrigue my intellect for quite some time.
I do maintain the ideation buffer to index these ideas into the larger context of my past musings, but I would also like a conveniently accessible chronological search available for cross-domain ideas.
I&rsquo;ll hence be increasing the frequency of premature technical thoughts being packaged into a micro-blogs.
I might not elaborate a whole lot in terms of the theoretical aspects of the tooling but I&rsquo;ll be conceptually outlining my current thoughts over the same.
I also like have quick research sweeps and building a link index in the ideation buffer: I feel doing that more publicly (the ideation buffer is any public but not so easily navigable) should help better create entry points into the buffer where my uncurated musings actually lie.
I&rsquo;m also getting into having an efficient pipeline (estimating expected latency from ideation (or resurgence from the buffer) to publishing to be less than 30 mins) so that I get into the habit of packaging my thoughts better rather than just dumping them as is in the ideation buffer.
Any misc updates do go in the now page.
As always, times are hex encoded.

`,content:`Emacs has been a trustworthy companion of mine for around 4+ years now. We&rsquo;ve shared some highs and lows. I owe a major fraction of whatever conceptual depth I maintain in computer science to messing around with my tools.
Emacs is also the core of my first major youtube breakthrough.
I haven&rsquo;t yet explored the emacs niche completely and will be investing more time into honing my repertoire and understanding what sort of mindset the tooling expects from you rather than just fitting emacs into my thoughts.
From a content creation perspective, I do find the act of spreading the word to be a noble pursuit (emacs also seems to be in demand btw).
As of now my journey with emacs is just beginning and I still feel the same amount of enthusiasm I first approached it with in the summer of 2020.

`,content:`I recently shifted my operations to a thinkpad x13g4amd (Ryzen 7840U + 780M Radeon) and am using this transfer as an opportunity to realize and improve my work related habits.
GNU/Linux All of my pipelines are based around Linux and the core GNU utils. I had to use windows for a while due to org-wide constraints but I&rsquo;ve recently been given the signal to shift to linux.
I rarely used any windows native tools for my workflows and there was always a layer of linux emulation/virtualization (wsl, scoop, and the likes) upon which I conducted my usual operations. Given I use Debian at home, a non native linux experience was frustrating at best and depressing at worst. No more, do I have to confine myself.
Fedora/Doom-gccEmacs Initially I entertained (read &ldquo;failed installation due to hardware incompatibilities&rdquo; (kernel panics)) the thought of Qubes for a while but running a hypervisor given I already am ssh&rsquo;ing into multiple virtual machines seemed to be an unnecessary overhead.
Dropping that idea, I turned to Fedora, thanks to a description that couldn&rsquo;t be ignored.
Initial perspectives: just the sweet spot between bleeding edge and hammer stable. I&rsquo;ve broken Arch before and do continue to use Debian to date so I do appreciate the consumer market that Fedora is going for.
The only issue (feature not bug) you might need to explicitly take care of in the latest distribution (I&rsquo;m on Fedora 40 workstation) is to disable MAC Address Randomization (good for security, but useful corporate networks that whitelist addresses).
It&rsquo;s not perfect but it does come ~95% of the way there. You might have to fix some drivers manually and will regularly experience the joy of fixing a new issue from time to time. So far the only major irk is the Quectel EM05G WWAN module not working post the first suspension of your system. After a reboot, you might need to manually unlock the module.
I do use a window manager for my home setup (i3wm) but am going for K DE Plasma 6 with this one (not a fan of the default Gnome DE) while I&rsquo;m transferring my workflows into CLI based routines.
Honestly I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be shifting to i3wm anytime soon as I do spend most of my time in emacs and firefox, the former of which is a good operating system in itself.
On that note, I recently shifting from vanilla Emacs to Doom and have been enjoying the defaults while not being blindsided to what&rsquo;s under the hood (been using vanilla for 3+ years now, and used vim for 18 months before that (cumulative 5)).
It&rsquo;s been 3 days into Doom and I appreciate the convenience and the power (recommend you use vim and emacs separately for a considerable duration before skipping to doom) - I don&rsquo;t experience any trade-offs yet.
Hardware This is my first (of many definitely (going to have a thinkpad shelf I bet)) Thinkpad(s) and now I understand what they&rsquo;re all about.
I&rsquo;m using a smaller model (&lt;14 inches) for portability (so that I can write anywhere) and a battery (52.5 WHr) life optimized build (opted for a low power 400 nit screen) with the AMD Ryzen Pro 7840U : and it&rsquo;s definitely not a disappointment - upon normal usage from my standards (spotify, emacs, alacritty, firefox), it estimates around 13 hours of usage, and that is nice.
The keyboard is just the right snappy and is fun to type with. I don&rsquo;t use the touchpad much and am not experienced in what makes a good touchpad so all I can say is there&rsquo;s nothing that disappoints me about it.
It does catch on fingerprints fairly easily and you might need some time adjusting to it. I, however, am not of the mind that a scratch ruins the build but rather see them as trophies, so what&rsquo;s a temporary smudge anyway.
Thoughts Good stuff.., will enjoy work more henceforth - you definitely can&rsquo;t be sad when you get to spend your days in emacs.

`,content:`check out what an IKN0x means here
Understanding different languages can open up one&rsquo;s mind towards different cultures.
The evolution of languages over centuries and common ancestors there-of over millenia indicates the evolution of cultural complexity.
The Conventional Take I grew up actively conversing in 4 languages: English, Hindi, Marathi and Gujrati. French was my first romance language I was exposed to for over 8 years (I say exposed as was learning this academically as a third language and didn&rsquo;t use this as a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; language as much as the others).
I&rsquo;ve dabbled a little in Latin and Greek in my junior year of my bachelors (dabbled ~ read an introductory book) and am currently getting into sanskrit to read up on some ancient indian literature in the close future.
Although these, of course, grant me quite the customized perspective of the world as every polyglot personally hones, they&rsquo;re not the most influential languages that I&rsquo;ve come across to influence my life.
Rather than being a device of communication, I see languages more as a means to understand a way of thought.
The Meta first implicitly learned about grammar, phonetics, and the likes when a toddler, thus conveying my needs efficiently, increasing my likelihood of survival in the longer run.
first picked up calculus when 14 to better understand physical phenomena and consequently was able to have sophisticated musings on my school commutes.
first explored lambda calculus in my sophomore year of college (don&rsquo;t know when started thinking procedurally (think all humans pick it up intuitively over a longer duration when relatively younger)) and could then begin understanding some of the more involved aspects of programming language theory and experiment with some myself.
soon actively delved into the world of symbolic algebra (via Lisp), enabling intense sequences of dreams laden with sexprs.
These are some of the self-initiated pursuits of mine that led to an immediate bump in the quality of my thoughts.
I consider a &ldquo;language&rdquo; in the more epistemological sense in that it allows me to understand something more elaborately.
Now, a quick search about the etymology of &ldquo;language&rdquo; (lingua from latin meaning tongue) would quickly render my proposition lacking in prominent ways, but that isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m going for here.
I&rsquo;ve been somewhat terse when recalling the anecdotes above but a language could be perceived as relating to different mindsets depending on what the situtation calls for.
A crude instance for this could be understanding the gradation between probability theory and luck over the gradual transition of the extent of your control over a set of events.
In the larger context of existing across a sequence of events then, being able to polyglottically (neologism) switch to what serves you best in the moment should best optimize your comprehension of existence.
Being a responsible logger I should mention that I temporarily had pseudo-diagnosed myself with cognitive dissonance (the psychological stress associated with juggling perceivably contradicting views) previously and there was a point when I even regretted my voracious intellectual appetite.
Although I presently enjoy having access to multiple orientations for attacking a domain (intermittently do feel otherwise), I&rsquo;ll recommend you gauge your neuro-elasticity before you actively pursue this path, for the perils may perish your perspecives.
I shall explore the downsides in detail in the posts that follow soon.
Ultimately, what I&rsquo;m after .. .. then, is to accumulate as many such abstract epistemological languages, to better my command over the poetic composition that the Uni-Verse is.
This definitely isn&rsquo;t the last of what you&rsquo;ll hear about this from me.

`,content:`I haven&rsquo;t been writing quite as much as I&rsquo;d like to lately and have been considering how I approach the whole thing.
Instead of talking about what I&rsquo;m thinking in the moment (pretty fleeting), I&rsquo;m &hellip;&hellip;
This is exactly the point where I&rsquo;ll go &ldquo;I&rsquo;m planning on &hellip;&rdquo; : I do not wish like doing that anymore. Talking about my momentary plans for a while has been quite the distraction that I occasionally enjoy.
Now, I&rsquo;m &hellip;.
There I go again, again had the urge to declare a plan. What is with this human urge to declare their plans rather than just getting on with what you wish to do.
Hitherto, I&rsquo;ve been doing this across multiple discplines and have been missing out the point of what I wished writing to be when I started out.
It started out as a way to understand my mind in a more intricate manner. Over time, I pivoted to the literal web-logging aspect and would log about anything and everything that I was getting myself into at that moment in time.
Over the span of multiple writing styles, ranging from downright deranged day dreaming, to terse technical texts, to pseudo-philosophical psychosocial sections of my brain&rsquo;s musings, to wishy-washy wanna-be alliterative compositions with the childish tendency for unnecessary lexical play, I could say I&rsquo;ve fairly captured a significant amount of my thinking modalities.
What for though, is what I wonder..
As of now, there isn&rsquo;t an explicitly tangible response to that nor an immediate denial of utility that pops up.
I feel I need a purpose-less vagabond-ish block of blogging to recalibrate what I&rsquo;m really after.
To not leave you (mostly me years down the lane revisiting this in an intellectually adrift state) high and dry, an explicit recommendation would be to double down on the randomness and let reversion to the mean do its thing over a series over purposeless productions.
This is probably the first piece of public writing, addressed to my future self.

`,content:`I finished my first pass of SICP (structure and interpretation of computer programs) around 3 years ago. Since, I&rsquo;ve realized the elegantly implicit existence of symbolic algebra in several domains that I personally explore on a regular basis.
That initial infatuation with Lisp ( and consequently symbolic computation ) has simmered and fermented enough in my mind to be realised as a potent generic thinking device. To cement my commitment to the same, I&rsquo;ll regularly dive deeper into relevant academia so I don&rsquo;t lose out on the joys of thinking for the sake of itself.
The first such rigorous choice after a period of seeking practicality when it comes to lisp is Adventures in Advanced Symbolic Programming (MIT OCW 6.945)
I&rsquo;ll be updating my progress in a reverse chronological stream, along with temporally independent note nodes in the ideation buffer at this specific node

`,content:`check out what an IKN0x means here
Snap-shotting projections of the mind over time is a good habit that you should practice.
I will try my best to persuade you of that&hellip;
An over-powered upside to pursuing multiple interests over the span of your life is to have the ability to compare and contrast multiple domains, akin to having multiple hill forts over your territory than only establishing a centralized castle.
In your conquests towards expanding your epistemological empire, you will have to chart out where you&rsquo;ve been and what you&rsquo;ve marked to be explored sometime down the lane.
Documentation doesn&rsquo;t have to be a duty Documentation, compared to actually building abstractions, is considered to be a somewhat inferior activity.
I personally have struggled with boredom as well when it came to documenting my deliverables from time to time at work.
I do acknowledge the importance of good documentation in any domain to help collaborators catch up to speed quickly and consequently speed up the expansion of the domain.
But I also do acknowledge that exploring nascent domains like an intellectual vagabond, or more ambitiously - an epistemological explorer, is a funner way to go about it.
My personality isn&rsquo;t quite the one that would like to criticise and account for existing discoveries but discover blooming phenomena myself.
Not that I look down on such structured duties but I&rsquo;d frame it as me admiring other cups of tea better.
Epistemology and Cartography are fairly fundamental domains that one could benefit by the merger of.
Intellectually charting out the philosophical theory of knowledge helps one undertake the task of building the bigger picture (or better yet, architect the matrix (I&rsquo;m inclined to assume the existence of one)) in a more delusionally ambitious and enthusiastic manner.
Don&rsquo;t &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Document&rdquo; Stuff Thinking in consequences of not carrying out a task can potentially turn out to be a better incentive than focusing on the gains of doing so: I regularly use the notion of negative rewards to keep me from avoiding a necessary task.
Snap-shotting projections of the mind over time is a &ldquo;good&rdquo; habit that you &ldquo;should&rdquo; practice.
That didn&rsquo;t sound quite compelling, right?
Let me hit you with what ensues if you choose otherwise:
Static Personality Syndrome Regular self-reflections indicate that you don&rsquo;t even need to put in the effort to really change an aspect about yourself : it&rsquo;s an inevitable characteristic of any abstraction that exists over a relatively long duration.
Lack there-of might result in an unjustified bias of your core thoughts being stagnant.
You probably just aren&rsquo;t registering the minor updates on a regular basis for an observable change to accumulate in an aware manner.
Still don&rsquo;t quite feel what I wish to convey, right?
Lemme infuse some intensity&hellip;
The Minotaur of Eureka Theseus laid out a red thread to help him traverse the labyrinth.
After chancing upon an intriguing insight, you run the risk of losing your intellectual bearing simply cause of the hormonal implications of a eureka.
Now, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with enjoying the occasional epistemological high but you have to retain a few designated drivers to take you back to a stable thought process again.
I speak from experience : marrying an elegant idea when you&rsquo;re sloshed in Vegas doesn&rsquo;t last as you&rsquo;d want it to and ends up with regrets. Love at first sight sounds romantic (and it is) but I like to hedge my paths when it comes to wisdom (doing it with women is probably not a wise piece of advice).
I recommend courting an idea over multiple dates, testing out if you really are for each other and only then promoting that idea to a personified muse.
Reverse chronological streams are my map (the red thread) saving me from the trauma of recursive introspection (the labyrinth) and consequent intellectual burnouts (the minotaur) : my journals (my epistemologial Ariadne) helped me realized the importance of always logging my exits and entries, however meager - prominence wise - they initially seem to be.
If you&rsquo;re not the techno-mythical kind of human (that is really, really sad), this won&rsquo;t hit hard as well &hellip;
Maybe.., I&rsquo;ll try casting a much wider wider net to mesmerize the largest chunk of personalities I can imagine - a lil&rsquo;bit of poetic imagery to the rescue &hellip;
The Gardener and the Butterfly Let&rsquo;s paint a picture&hellip;,
In this garden of domains do you wish to be the eternally euphoric butterfly that roams around experiencing the flowers of the instantaneous present, potentially sacrificing macro-awareness..
or
Do you wish to be the gardener tending to a more elaborate context, to see your tendees (domains that you tend to (this isn&rsquo;t a word)) mature and flourish into trees, yielding calm shades, allowing you to enjoy the butterflies while you sip away on a warm cup of coffee..
To emphasize the already evident, I prefer the latter and am willing to put in the hardwork that goes into maturing your edgy intellect into peaceful wisdom.
Document Stuff Snap-shotting projections of the mind over time is a GOOD habit that you SHOULD practice.
Now, I hope that hit just the right spot, leaving you calm and satisfied (That&rsquo;s what the muse said in my head) &hellip;

`,content:`Currently, I prefer tracking the temporal increments of my existence (&ldquo;age&rdquo; is what normal humans would say this means) via hex timestamps.
Years ago, I kept track of my age in years and months like normal humans do.
I maintain the habit of analysing my mindset every major temporal mileston in my life - when I turned 10 (I don&rsquo;t quite remember exactly how I felt then) or 20, for instance, in accordance with the widely accepted gregorian calendar.
Today, I turned 0x2222 days old and can accurately recall the day I typed a similar post for when I turned 0x2000 (has been archived for privacy reasons as of now). If I hadn&rsquo;t adopted such a personal system, I would have deprived myself of such convenient memory indexes.
I also am able to better gauge my progress over major hex jumps than thinking of this phase as (2*16^2 + 2*16 + 2 = 546 days) 1.495 years.
Moving over from evangelizing fellow humans to have personalized hex calendars, I don&rsquo;t quite feel any major mindset change today but do acknowledge the accumulation of some stable mental models that have snowballed over the past 0x222 days.
The most important humans in my network usually wish me on such milestones (that would be zero, as of now - perhaps, we&rsquo;re not quite the social species that we claim to be).
I actually prefer it to be this way as I never quite bought the idea of celebrating one&rsquo;s pseudo helical revolution (the solar system&rsquo;s revolving around the milky way&rsquo;s center as well, which in turn is moving as well so &ldquo;pseudo helical&rdquo; is a very generous euphemism) around the sun.
Sometimes, I wonder as to how do we plan on going intergalactic and discovering the likes of tatooine if we emotionally attach fundamentally prominent abstractions such as time to the likes of a star that&rsquo;ll die away soon (relatively speaking, this post may survive with some non-zero finite (non-infinitesimal) probability but the sun will cease to exist with certainty).
Humans should strive towards having more robust attachments if we really wish to progress as a species.
BTW, I&rsquo;ve waned out philosophically rambling about existence for every major temporal milestones now which I&rsquo;m finding to be quite relaxing.
I&rsquo;m going to enjoy while that lasts - consequently, this just turned out to be an intellectually light hearted post and I don&rsquo;t quite mind that.
Probably will post such a light hearted update when I&rsquo;m 0x2345, 0x2468 and &hellip; I&rsquo;m out of creative patterns as of now. But definitely reporting back on 0x3000.

Context I intend to formalize my plans of getting good at multiple domains not for the reputation that follows but for the generic insight about the world that you may harness as a result.
This is the second refactor of the way I approach this subject and this time around I will be pushing for practical indicators that allow me to gauge my progress over time.
Initially, I wish to establish sound, but nascent (will maintain flexibility initially) foundations over the course of docuementing the evolution of my thoughts.
In the last 5 years I have accumulated a somewhat interesting world view that I wish to start consolidating in a structure manner to better file relevances and accomodate developments in the same.
Documentation The documentation will be synchronized vlog and blog releases that capture the evolution of this personal domain over time.
A cluster root has been initialized in the ideation buffer that will track the developments in an elaborate and fine grained manner compared to what is posted on the main blog.
A relevant video playlist will also be initialized soon where I will capture the growth of this epistemological personal project over time.
I plan all releases being concise captures, the format of which I&rsquo;ll converge upon in due time, over multiple iterations.
Nomenclature and Release Cycle An IKN0x is short for:
I K(now) N(ot) 0x(timestamp of number of days I&rsquo;ve been alive) The first three are a pointer to recursive poem published around 2 years ago which captures my attitude towards generic knowledge fairly succintly

`,content:`Writing is an involved process. A rough overview is as follows:
you think of an idea you build upon that idea with what you already know you structure out some initial drafts you run it under a careful eye to scrape out the loopholes you edit it, to the point of satisfaction The problem with that process is the last bullet right there. It makes the worth of a word in the moment diminish than the act of etching something down in stone.
Up until this point in this microessay (excluding the title), I&rsquo;ve been editing out typos immediately and am maintaining a reversibility of around ~5 words. That is an interesting exercise but it isn&rsquo;t the end of the world.
From the end of this sentence, whatever I type, stays as if I&rsquo;ve etched it onto stone. I keep the typso as well and do not backtrack. There is no backspace, no tab completoin (I&rsquo;m using emacs)., no correcting punctuations that I did not intend to fill in, no grammatical corrections, ; if my sentence sounds like sh*t, my sentences* are shi*t.
This is a lexical game that I&rsquo;&rsquo;ll be regularly practicing henceforth to ramp up the worth of a workd. It&rsquo;s going to be more attuned towards natural language as there&rsquo;s no time travel whn you talk. you can&rsquo;t fix up something in the past. All that I can change is the formating (using markdown) so that teh medium doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of my words beging portrayed the way I realize tehm first in my mind.
Now, typos are not a thought but an action issue and hwo well I control my fingures (damn it&hellip;), I do see some phonetic overloading going on that is infuluencing my base intuitions of awhat a word looks likt.
Core biases when I type something are slso survacing readily and it is quite interesting to see how we favor certain areas of the keyboard when we think of a letter rather than that specific key. For instance, &ldquo;,&rdquo;,&quot;.&quot;,&quot;&rsquo;&quot;,&quot;;&quot; are all somewhat intuitively grouped into a cluster with the specificity being recalled upon based on the context of your current phase of thought when you&rsquo;re typing own a sentence.
what is teh oint of this exercise you may ask:-
I wis hto rveal my true though process types are an initial hurdle that I&rsquo;ll just have to ignore and get better at in the background the major baeneifit is that I get to actually write like I&rsquo;m thinking in the moment. I could plan way before I write adwon a sentence but that would suck the joy ourt of this and wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to completely explore my base inclinations. Humans, can figure out types -&gt; typose pretty esily and this shouldn&rsquo;t readily hinder their comprehension. I&rsquo;d only user -&gt; use unnatural devices (-&gt; is not a part of natral language) to avoid conufusion in cases of semantic overlap.s. All such posts will be tagged as free-writing ; this is a micro-essay as well and I lpan on doing these more often or atleast one a day. Of course , you may rely me (fit in an on before the me in there) to conduct this out honestly and not feign spontatneity .
I&rsquo;ve go t some other lexical gaems as well that i occasionaly enjoy ; will talk about thame in other posts. This is enough lexical crime commited for the day.

`,content:`I find most sources of information these days (since several years) to be too noisy compared to the actual signals of wisdom you expect from a popular source.
Rarely, I&rsquo;ll pull up the news application on my phone and consume a whole bunch of generic, and some domain specific news.
Other than state of the art research in a technical domain, which is based upon a corpora of established citations, most other &ldquo;new&rdquo; stuff is noise.
Such media doesn&rsquo;t particularly invoke any extreme emotion other than temporary intellectual intrigue at best. At worst, it might be a shun or an indifferent scroll.
I might not even recall a piece of news that I&rsquo;d consumed fairly recently, almost akin to a tweet or a reel that I scroll past to pass short slots of time during the day.
Now, social media is explicitly looked down upon due to several obvious reasons that I do not intend on enumerating out right now.
But consuming news is a somewhat societally neutral (positive even, according to some) phenomenon that I personally find to be best formulated to make it sound like the consumer engages with the world around actively.
It allows you to put on the facade of &ldquo;being in the know&rdquo;, to feign awareness.
Although truly being aware has philosophical connotations that I haven&rsquo;t fully explored yet, consuming news doesn&rsquo;t particularly align with any of my major life goals relevant to this domain.
Reading research backed books is a much better investment in so that what you read stays with you in a consolidated, sub-conscious manner. This will nudge the status of your mind presently just enough to make a difference than if you hadn&rsquo;t read the book.
With news, all that is poured in stays on the surface due to its fluffy nature and also readily evaporates the moment you move on.
I personally haven&rsquo;t ever faced noticeabely severe consequences of being in the generic dark. Anything that is too important always is the first thing to come up at lunch or dinner.
Why bother then, is what I&rsquo;d like to leave this micro-essay at.

`,content:`ESDS Software Solutions Ltd. (where I work currently) was lately the technical facilitator for the School Education Department of the Government of Maharashtra, towards conducting a state level slogan competition, the winner of which was rewarded by a lunch with the chief minister of Maharashtra.
Brief Context One of the records (total of 3) they were going for was the most number of handwritten notes uploaded to a bespoke platform in 24 hours.
The scale of photos we were talking about is 1.4e6. Post the pipelines we applied:
a meta-data based deduplication filter an unsupervised anomaly detection filter (need to really have a handwritten note) a tampering detection filter (no editing - used Error level analysis) The final reported qualified collection was around 1.1e6 handwritten notes which were verified and the record plaque was presented on 5th of March 2024.
The previous record was for around 1e4 images.

`,content:`Speech and the word written, are potential expressions of a thought. Each one of us enjoys a different mix of how we best convey ourself.
Ever since I began blogging when I was 19, I&rsquo;ve been prioritising descriptiveness over precision. I feel I&rsquo;ve entered a mental state where I value the distilled value of the transmission more than the exhaustiveness of the message.
I also notice a rift between the way I speak and the way I write. Not to say that any one of them is superior than the other but I could use an exercise in convergence - projecting them both onto a common ground.
I hypothesize that the act of enforcing a common implicit representation for my speech and my writing will better enrich the way I think : for I anticipate the waves of my mind when crafting a sentence, and practice intuitively surfing them when navigating a conversation a certain way.
This in turn should help me be a better thinker, writer and conversationalist.
On to the pragmatics of accelerating this intent into consequences, I&rsquo;ll be writing more often than usual and would keep it slightly aloof than what I&rsquo;m reading currently. Instead, I&rsquo;ll focus on ideas that I&rsquo;ve previously encountered in fragments and try sensibly collating them.
Self criticism is another aspect that I&rsquo;ll be translucent about to really document my progress with the same. For starters I&rsquo;ve a tendency to get a little too abstract, a little to quickly. I&rsquo;ve already deviated quite a bit from what I initially set out to convey in this micro-essay (this does show a potential market for version controlled essays). That either highlights the way writing refines your thought, or.., how raw one&rsquo;s thought is that it requires an hour of active refinement to really understand what one thinks.
We shall soon find out, over the following season of abstract musings, how well I stand true to my promise of iterative convergence - over a series of relevant blogs (here) and unscripted monologues (youtube). If you&rsquo;d like to know what goes on under the hood with a higher frequency of updates, checkout the ideation buffer.

`,content:`This is a brief update on the nootropics post in which I initialized my current stack and promised for a review down the lane.
I&rsquo;m back on a controlled dosage of caffeine - 80 mg (dawn) + 80 mg (afternoon). Each cup is supplmented with 100 mg of L-theanine and also dump in 5+ grams of creatine in the dawn. Both do their job well and will continue them this cycle.
From the last phase, I&rsquo;m most indifferent to L-tyrosine and dropping out of that this cycle. The melatonin did their job well but will cycle in magnesium instead this time. That, along with ashwagandha will form the backbone of my sleep stack.
From a physical perspective, jumping rope for 45 mins thrice a week, along with an hour long barefoot rush up a small hill - both in golden early mornings. That is descent sunlight exposure. Do cycle around (have a fat bike) on weekends sometime. Resistance training 6 times a week for an hour at dawn. This, I feel, is necessary for I like to actively engage with matter around me than just being in my own head all the time.
To put it concisely, physical exertion is mental rest.
The control this cycle is going to be magnesium and elevated levels of cardiovascular training.
I&rsquo;ll be logging such updates more frequently henceforth and keeping it a little more dispassionate and pragmatic than usual.

`,content:`I&rsquo;m an AI Research Engineer and that involves messing around a little with python. I&rsquo;ve spent the past 4 years perfecting a disciplined, minimal, but enabling setup.
This is a tour of my trusty set of tools, in the hopes that it will help you find the same CLI zen that I&rsquo;ve been enjoying for a while now.
Tmux : towards an Eternal Shell I start my work sessions off by ssh&rsquo;ing into my remote compute cluster.
I don&rsquo;t type in my passwords all the time and prefer being a little lazy. So, sshpass(stores credentials) and an aliased bash script do the job reliably.
~/remote/dev.sh #!/bin/bash sshpass -f ~/remote/dev_pass.txt \\ ssh -t -L 8000:localhost:8000 -p 5522 \\ &lt;username&gt;@&lt;IP&gt; \\ &#39;tmux attach -t hq || tmux new -s hq&#39; Tunnel forwarding comes in handy when you want to use web based applications or want to run an HTTP server on a whim. You may additionally range over multiple ports using a bash loop in case you need to use multiple utilities (Jupyter on one, MkDocs on another for instance).
Lastly, I don&rsquo;t just drop into the naked shell but into a tmux session. The command above first attempts to attach session named &ldquo;hq&rdquo;. Failure results in the creation thereof. Success short-circuits the latter&rsquo;s execution and you&rsquo;re into whatever you were last working on.
*~/.bashrc alias dev=&#34;~/remote/dev.sh&#34; alias avx=&#34;~/remote/avx.sh&#34; alias avx_prod=&#34;~/remote/avx_prod.sh&#34; alias avx_resch=&#34;~/remote/avx_research.sh&#34; Finally, a bunch of aliases further reduce your time-to-shredding-the-remote-file-system. If you&rsquo;re already investing into how you access your clusters, when you actually open up your workspace, you gotta &hellip;
.. Edit like you mean it I&rsquo;ve used my fair share of editors to finally have a favourite when it comes to working remotely.
For personal projects, I use evil gccemacs and won&rsquo;t ever stop doing so. However, for remote work, nothing beats the sleekness of vim (using neovim, to be specific)
Emacs with tramp mode just doesn&rsquo;t cut it (I haven&rsquo;t tried running CLI emacs remotely because my keybindings are a tad too crazy for a terminal emulator to handle correctly).
To summarize, emacs is the souped up tank and neovim + tmux makes for the vagabond-warrior-way to get on with your job surgically.
Given we&rsquo;re pretending to be spartans, Neovim + Tmux it is.
Btw, going minimal doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re going unprepared and compromised. Neovim is relatively minimal to Emacs but it gets the job done and a whole lot more.
Moreover, my experience with one enhances my workflow in the other (I use evil emacs and nvim with Neogit (Neovim&rsquo;s Magit), for instance (one of several)).
Also .., don&rsquo;t even think of VS code, just don&rsquo;t&hellip;
Contain your Enthusiasm Working on multiple projects might call for working on the same libraries with different versions. This may be handled easily if you&rsquo;re working in a uniform ecosystem, say only with python libraries (check out micromamba -&gt; that&rsquo;s pretty spartanish) but throw in other dependencies that a polyglotic application might ask for and you&rsquo;ll quickly realize the nightmare you&rsquo;ve signed up for.
So.., check out docker and how containers help segregate your mess.
Miscellaneous I also use several utilities that aren&rsquo;t particularly a part of any specific umbrella-of-a-tool.
A Simple HTTP server python -m http.server &lt;port&gt; That exposes your current filesystem and has been a convenient tool when I want to share files across my research cluster.
You may just wget the specific file from the server or browse the directory listing using lynx. I&rsquo;d recommend you reserve this method for smaller files that you&rsquo;d like to be accessible across your cluster. rsync or scp are the usual alternatives otherwise. Of course you could always just access that in a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; browser if you want to access these on your GUI host.
I personally prefer documenting my code and my thought process the same time I&rsquo;m building something so I always fire up an auto doc-er. I use mkdocs and given that we&rsquo;re in tmux, my documented approaches and thought processes are always accessible over my IP:port on the research cluster. So that is also how I provide context to my mates about what I&rsquo;m up to.
GNU coreutils The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system. These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system.
For instance, to quickly check the number of entities in a parent entity I&rsquo;d use an enlister, piped into the line count variant of wc.
cat records.csv | wc -l tree cats-and-dogs-directory | wc -l There are some days when I need to manipulate a file in a very old docker container that doesn&rsquo;t have vim. sed does come in handy such days and has saved me quite some time, numerous times.
sed -i &#39;/good_sentinels/s/42/1729/&#39; answer_to_everything.org Say there&rsquo;s a zombie process lying around that might need a quick kill: grep and awk then come in handy :
ps aux | grep &#39;Z&#39; | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39; | xargs kill -9 This is just scraping the surface with what you can do with the core utils. Considering the powerful interface capabilities of these with vim and you&rsquo;ve got yourself an enviable setup running at a fraction of the compute of what your run of the mill IDE consumes.
Farewell, for now, and good luck sharpening your technical repertoire&hellip;
Tools don&rsquo;t make the Trader, but &hellip;, they kinda do&hellip;
&ndash; I made that up
P.S. I side with evil gccemacs in the editor wars&hellip;

`,content:`I&rsquo;ve been formally delving into epistemology and relevant lateral root domains recently and have been re-encountering several ideas that I&rsquo;d previously casually explored with intrinsic motivation.1
This isn&rsquo;t my first accidental implicit intersection of thoughts with core philosophical theories like constructivist epistemology and ontology.2
Given my natural inclinations towards personal interdisciplinary research, apart from my core specializations, I do deliberately maintain an extensive scaffolding around several domains that I plan to build foundations in soon. This allows me to generalize over multiple realizations of similar concepts in different epistemological clusters and identify some interesting patterns.3
I&rsquo;ve been dealing with the abstract notion of reality for a while now. My explicit dive into the same was about 4 years ago when I was exploring the tibetan yogas of dream and sleep.4 This was triggered by a particular lucid dream5 feeling all too real - incepting ideas about what really exists and what feels like it exists but is just a neuronal game your mind plays on you (or itself - who&rsquo;s &ldquo;you&rdquo; - are we really sure? (who&rsquo;s &ldquo;we&rdquo; - (&ldquo;who&rdquo;&rsquo;s really asking these questions))).
I actively practiced the meditations and techniques relevant to lucidity for around 20 months for during the beginning of my 20&rsquo;s (am ~23.5 now) and did quite some cool stuff:
practiced jump rope tricks to build muscle memory practiced form for the big 3 lifts when I was just starting out with powerlifting had plans for crafting a dream bat cave where I would work on stuff I used to work in my waking life but with all the imaginary bells and whistles manipulated matter like Neo could in the matrix It was basically a consequence-free6 sand box that allowed you to do a bunch of societally questionable stuff and realize all your thought experiments.
It wasn&rsquo;t all work and this practice also doubled as an extremely vivid first person gaming console. Crudely speaking (very crude), dreams are the result of your brain consolidating memories and abstract thoughts, filling in gaps to make sense of the current abstract notion being processed : I used this to schedule movie nights when I was sleeping by consuming some intense first person video game footage7 and play out similar scenarios in the dream.
All this un-proctored fooling around does take its unique mental toll and you might start questioning the existence of your waking life to some extent. So I&rsquo;d recommend you approach this field with a little caution as to never forget about what &ldquo;really&rdquo;8 matters.
My intention with this post is to highlight the ubiquity of some philosophically loaded domains like epistemology and ontology - that I could personally encounter significant aspects of these without a formal introduction to the same. It was only after I&rsquo;d done a bit of thinking for myself that I began researching philosophical outlooks on what I was practically experiencing.
Happy &ldquo;reality&rdquo;&hellip;
It does feel nice to rediscover a prominent thought and later realise that it has been formalized and well-documented - makes me feel like one is asking the right questions when beginning with a new domain.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
Did approach something similar independently on my old blog&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
One of the three logical reasoning embodiments: Inductive&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
Dream Yoga, by Andrew Holocek is a great beginner oriented read&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LaBerge is a great theologically agnostic introduction that I myself began with.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
I&rsquo;m not sure of this claim - spiritually speaking - I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;read&rdquo; that if you chop off trolls with customized blades of chaos and rampage around a bunch, that is bad karma some how&hellip;&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
https://dyinglightgame.com/ : amazing stuff, highly recommend for the purposes discussed above. Another (not first person though so you&rsquo;ll need some imagination) good alternative is https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/days-gone&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
there was a point where I used to wonder quite a lot about what does &ldquo;real&rdquo; really mean? Such questions are indicative of introspection but in my personal opinion, not worth dedicating too much effort into if you can&rsquo;t figure them out right away - see Zen Koans.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

`,content:`I partition my days in phases of different mindsets that allow me to cater to my varying epistemological hungers. One of them is a daily ninety minute ideation hunt and feast that helps keep my skills sharp.
The laws of thermodynamics do form a formidable devil that really does mess up your ordered habits if you do not inject in the necessary energy from time to time.1
As a way to sharpen the intellectual axe, I envision myself going on domain hunts to allot myself a new class of game to look forward to during minor breaks from my usual, comparatively conventional endeavors.
Variation in what you eat builds robustness and allows you to not fall prey to the periodic fluctuations in the interest ecosystems of your mind. Failure to do so might result in alternating times of excess and scarceness, thereby limiting your extent of control over your tendencies in the moment.
I&rsquo;d prefer equanimity over a roller-coaster in the long term: for adrenaline fades fast, but a sound purpose persists longer than the waxes and wanes of disinterest and infatuations.
Reading diversely and not depending on limited and specialized sources of brain food does aid one to not throw a fit and when they momentarily encounter the inevitable dip of boredom in a certain domain.
Life may just give you lemons, but it&rsquo;s up to you to hunt for the berries and the bats.
Once locked on a prey, I might have a month-long infatuation test for that domain and if it survives, I add it to reliable sources from which I can draw upon later when I need to fill in a gap in my schedule.
In cases of distaste, experience is experience, a null response is another input, checked off, that doesn&rsquo;t tend to your sorts of rewards.
While one may antagonize me here by drawing upon the arrows of focus and specialization : I personally do not view the core of domains to be so disconnected that their mutual knowledge does not elevate the collective comprehension - I perceive their tactical combination to be greater than the sum of their individual worths.

`,content:`Some-days, I wonder that I&rsquo;m born half a millennia too late into this world given the extent of novel societal tendencies that I&rsquo;m not fond of.
Although, the notion of Batman didn&rsquo;t exist then, given a choice, I&rsquo;d probably consider time traveling to an intellectually simpler life when much of what the present science and engineering entails was just beginning to be discovered and invented.
Research options then weren&rsquo;t thresholded by who&rsquo;s packing heavier compute but rather open to all that could observe patiently and portrayed the will to ask, sceptic-ize and act according to their whims.
On the shoulders of Giants&hellip; In the earlier days of most subject, huge anchors of contributions originate from a series of fundamental minor observations, to now forking into numerous finer threads that tangibly realized in the growing amounts of research corpus these days.
The idea of conducting personal research and devising minor domains is continuously being limited to a select few over the decades as apprentices struggle to catch up with finer and finer bleeding edges of something that was so blunt and casually approachable a few hundred years ago.
Although this signifies a growth in complexity of abstractions that humanity has explored as a collective, it does seem to be a gloomy scenario for the curious observer bounded by his natural instruments of observation.
The chances of discovering even the remotest of abstractions independently are ruined by hyper-connected populations. The chances of chancing upon the same intellectual abstraction twice from different roots have dwindled down to none thanks to the power of the written word and lately, computer networks.
A Proposition - Cyber-Solitude One possible panacea for this diverse set of intellectual deficiencies that&rsquo;s forced upon dwellers of the current times, that I&rsquo;ve been testing out is to deliberately distance myself from news and assume a particular thought hasn&rsquo;t been thought of before even though there&rsquo;s a high chance it has been, several times. It might even be recorded in some corners of the internet and be conveniently accessible due to LLMs slowly replacing search engines.
Moreover, not reading up the ends of a thread and only restricting yourself to foundational reads, forcing a rewarding climb up the trees of knowledge to the particular section of a canopy you were searching for is a preferable path for me than observing a snapshot of the same from a satellite zoom-in.
I&rsquo;m not Bad-Mouthing Intellectual Interdependence &hellip; &hellip; but there&rsquo;s a pretty obvious and distinct line between riding a jet across continents and what the wright brothers did over the span of a green field.
While I can&rsquo;t deny the usefulness of the former, I hope you are lucky enough to realize the joy of doing something similar to the latter.
Pseudo-Originality Personally, I&rsquo;ve found trying to come with non-optimal explanations of phenomena around me before looking up the tested and accurate versions to be a fulfilling habit that might just help me retain my sanity and feed my need for natural novelty than drown myself in readily available facts and factoids.
This isn&rsquo;t a jab at collaborative science but a call to independently practice the solitary variant of the same. Both present a different sort of satisfaction that might just be the combination needed for a balanced intellectual diet.

`,content:`Two days ago I found myself scrolling mindlessly for half an hour and I decided I need to decide for real as to how I&rsquo;m going to deal with this issue.
The problem with such a habit is that it is very convenient, engaging and it slices into precious time that I&rsquo;d rather spend doing something more difficult and rewarding like reading.
While devising a strategy to deal with this behaviour, I concluded that videos themselves (long and short form) are the culprit to these new time sinks that I&rsquo;ve been experiencing.
Another neural bait that cyber/social attention engineers employ to capture my attention is the use of vivid colours and forcing unnecessary notifications in places where I&rsquo;d simply prefer getting in, completing a specific task and getting out. For this very reason, I hate youtube and instagram for integrating shorts into the main application and not allowing a way to disable them.
Given I plan to create content based on my interests, I cannot do away with these platforms completely.
A few decisions I&rsquo;ve taken for damage control given the inevitability of the need to be on such platforms for content creators are as follows:
Limit usage to specific times of the day and only if I want to post something, never to consume content I listen to most of my podcasts on spotify and fallback to youtube only in cases I needed something more peculiar always read up first before I watch a video describing the same : always prefer text - It&rsquo;s faster and more precise for me. the alternative is just me being lazy and I&rsquo;d rather relax than watch something of importance lazily. Using my phone in grayscale mode at all times : this is a life-saver, my eyes have never felt so well rested (It&rsquo;s been more than a week now). building a habit of reading on my phone rather than scrolling : this is a relatively more demanding ask and has to be dealt with strategically.. I maintain around half a dozen active reads (all ebooks) at a time so that I can read according to my whims and am not stuck to a specific kind of content at all times of the day. Be patient, and meditate mathematically and philosophically, on my environment, playing my own mental games. Not pulling out the phone during the smallest of breaks is another useful habit. If I do have to consume a long form video, I&rsquo;ll add it to watch laters and only listen to the audio during walks or commutes. If it is important, written sources will always exist and should be preferred over videos. Limit instagram usage to my desktop; again only to post content regarding my content creation pursuits. All the important people in my life have my cell number accessible. being okay with being bored - This is a superpower. Consuming mostly text throughout my day does help with not overstimulating my mind.

`,content:`I&rsquo;ve been building up my vimrc again because emacs&rsquo; tramp mode just wasn&rsquo;t cutting it when it came to speed for my remote work environments.
I&rsquo;ve been a vim user for around 4 years now and having read some books partially and sampling a lot of blogs and conference recordings over this span, I decided I should commit and formally invest into a definitive resource to get me upto speed and beyond.
I&rsquo;d began Learn vim the hard way before I shifted to emacs fulltime but I decided emacs lisp was much better than learning vimscript for a longer time horizon.
I definitely am not leaving emacs anytime soon. All my writing and personal projects will be hosted by evil gccemacs and will only be using vanilla vim + tmux setup for python, shell and relevant data science oriented utilities on my remote setup.
So, Given my hyper-enthusiastic personality when it comes to reading everything before I begin with something : I decided to read the book Learn vim the smart way.
I learned a lot in 4 dense days (everything before 0x217B (inclusive) pertains to comments in the book) and was blown away by some pretty neat peculiarities as well.
I would say that all the CLI interaction made me reminisce about my sophomore year in university when I was in awe of the terminal and first began blogging in a minimal setup with markdown files via jekyll in vim: this was a few months before the pandemic I believe. Blogging and the terminal is what kept me intellectually ticking.
Emacs did come in later on because I considered my options to upgrade my productivity:
learn a whole bunch of unix utilities to fully exploit vim (command mode, etc) learn one unified software that can do everything and more Plus, the affinity of the parenthesis made it pretty easy to choose.
Getting back to the point, I&rsquo;ve setup a minimal dot file right now that allows me get things done without much overheads.
I don&rsquo;t particularly miss being out of emacs, I consider I&rsquo;m mature enough now (I would definitely throw a tantrum a couple years ago) to not associate work with the tool but just get things done.
I mean, I still do use evil emacs and learning about the core of vim more would still level up my editing game, so its not really a equal comparison. Emacs still does encompass everything.
For instance, just one of the many new things I realized from this productivity fiasco (exaggerating) is that vim macros and registers are just different interpretations of the same underlying data structure.
Macros are code and Registers are the source of fetching instructions of that code.
The craziest thing I&rsquo;ve done recently is write a contorted recursive macro by debugging it by printing it as contents of a register and yanking the updates, post editing into the same variable to test it out as a macro again, only to repeat until success.
Need I say more&hellip;, the day I started out editing text in VS code in freshman year, I never thought I&rsquo;d be able to be so lazy in the future when it comes to manipulating programs: thanks to the book, I&rsquo;m thinking much more and moving much less than I used to 4 days ago.

`,content:`I&rsquo;ve decided to increase my frequency of writing on the main blog to get more reps in and converge onto my style quickly than if I continued with long form content only.
I&rsquo;m also going to practice being more concise, and blogging a little more on technical aspects as well.
My usual blog post goes to around 1500-2000 words and that isn&rsquo;t helpful for covering some minor writing prompts I&rsquo;d like to explore.
Long form content helps build up context but sometimes I&rsquo;d just like talking about an idea and seed an intrigue into the readers' minds. Writing about how stuff can be done is interesting but pushing readers to ponder upon certain topics seems more fulfilling to me. Writing, I believe, is inherently about sharing ideas and not just sharing solutions to definite problems.
Around 2 weeks ago, I&rsquo;d brainstormed around 20 such shorter prompts during a night walk post dinner and I really enjoyed the idea of elaborating upon them in these posts.
Being precise is a skill that I actively want to work on and I find such posts to be the perfect candidate to build my planning and structuring habits when it comes to conveying something succinctly and convincingly.
Getting better at rhetoric is, in my belief, something everyone should keep in mind, as it is a fundamental skill applicable to all forms of communication
This blog post was created during a free-flowing writing session and has taken no more than 10 minutes of my effort with another 5 minutes of refactoring and editing.
All such posts will be tagged as a microessay henceforth to notify you of the effort I&rsquo;ve put in.

`,content:`I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a denser review of such a technical and diverse domain. It&rsquo;d been more a year since I graduated (majored in computer science and minored in artificial intelligence) and so I decided to brush up on some basics and consolidate what I&rsquo;d studying since the past ~4 years.
I also picked up the book to systematically populate my org-roam buffer and have my root node rooted here in the braindump.
Do note that I avoid noting concepts down verbatim and always try to write stuff down the way I&rsquo;d like to formulate it for my future self.
This is the official distribution site of the book: https://themlbook.com/
I wouldn&rsquo;t particularly recommend this for beginners (a more pedagogically friendly course is a better intro to such a dense field : I personally began properly with the Fast.AI series but there&rsquo;s many more respectable intros out there) but would rate it as an extremely useful revision index into the domain.
When researching/working in the industry, one usually delves into a particular subdomain. That&rsquo;s necessary and all but this book did help me in forming a better bigger picture of the field and did so very quickly to be honest : I log my work sessions with the org-mode timing system and it took me around 14 hours to read the book from end to end while formulating my notes in the brain dump.
I do want to get onto some more academically inclined reads soon - a little busy with work and personal pursuits as of now to continue with a dense and large read right away.

`,content:` To know thyself, is the beginning of wisdom
Socrates
On tangibility of the past All of us create content, every moment, tuned to varying extents of influence and permanence.
It&rsquo;s intent that separates us all into different leagues of producers.
Let me explain via a hierarchical build up of selected formats of content with varying intensity.
Note that the list isn&rsquo;t exhaustive by any means and I&rsquo;ve deliberately excluded works of larger scale (movies, video games : they have the potential to be the most influential kind of content out there).
Memories: Personal reflections for self, minimal intent beyond preserving moments.
Photos and Videos: Captured experiences for personal enjoyment and sharing with friends and family, moderate intent for preserving and sharing life highlights.
Journal Entries: Personal thoughts for self or select readers, growing intent for self-expression.
Social Media Posts: Daily updates for social circles, moderate to high intent for sharing moments.
Vlogs: Video diaries for followers, moderate to high intent for personal connection.
Podcasts: Audio discussions for niche or general listeners, moderate to high intent for sharing insights.
Blogs: Knowledge sharing for a diverse online audience, high intent for educating and engaging.
Books: In-depth guides for readers, high intent for sharing expertise.
Autobiography: A comprehensive life story for readers, high intent for sharing a personal journey.
These are tangible realizations of indices into our past. There also exist psychological indices that one creates when that don&rsquo;t completely fall into the category of being a memory: working on a project for a long time, so much so that it becomes a part of your life temporarily and allows you to recall exactly how the days passed when working on it.
Serves me well, this pursuit &hellip; For me, reading books with a definite purpose suited to my learning pursuits has been such a strong creator of psychological indices that I could recite my lifestyle when I was reading a particular book and what unique characteristic was different about my life then.
Around two years ago, I remember being able to recite and consolidate my days during all the hundred diverse books I&rsquo;d read when I crossed that checkpoint.
It was a revelation. I wasn&rsquo;t aware that I had the ability to remember so densely, something that hadn&rsquo;t been physically recorded.
That was the first time I understood the power of consuming and creating content with intent.
I began blogging again recently and I&rsquo;d forgotten some major aspects of my life post a minor rough patch. I read my old blogs some while ago and I was able to recall the characteristics of my old self, all the philosophical ramblings I&rsquo;d already progressed with and all the metaphysical checkpoints my personality had achieved.
That wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible hadn&rsquo;t I been blogging regularly for the major half of my bachelors. I was able to capture the most formative years of my life and record the psychological adaptations and growth through it.
It wasn&rsquo;t just the blogs, but all the activities that were done with intent that created such strong indices that allowed me to be more self-reflective and be able to know myself better. The habit of blogging only serves as a maturing agent of sorts, consolidating and solidifying these malleable memories.
If not for the habit of blogging, I still would do a lot of the things I did but I would be a completely different person for the nature of my consolidation phases would&rsquo;ve been comparatively fluffier.
What chapter? Your unaltered perspective about your own life ,captured at regular, frequent instances will probably produce a fairly noisy and jittery signal. The past is what actually stabilizes your perception of your present and highlights probable trajectories for your future.
Your absolute past is definite and no one&rsquo;s ever aware of the complete truth (what is that really?). Your perception of your past, however, is again a variable that is dependent on your noisy present. If you&rsquo;d like being anchored to a specific trajectory or at least have a stable outlook towards uncertainty for your future. I&rsquo;d consider imparting some inertia to your perceptions.
Writing (maintaining journals, for starters) is definitely the perfect tool in your arsenal which requires deliberate focus. It gives you the option to be extremely intentional with what you put down in words.
Even if you have a noisy present, penning down a page or two about what&rsquo;s on your mind rids you of the noise that allows you to get on with actually extracting what really needs to be captured.
I&rsquo;d put it right alongside a long music-free run at the crack of dawn - after the initial grind and post finding the groove it frees you of your intense emotions and your irrational biases, allowing you to think appropriately, as life always demands (being care-free is a luxury not many of us can afford).
With this inertial anchor of perspectives at your disposal, you can lay down a path of breadcrumbs from your past into your present, making your personality&rsquo;s progress tractable.
It helps you structure past chapters in your life, while planning for future ones robustly which is quite the superpower any protagonist would enjoy while formulating their own story.
The most important book you&rsquo;ll ever read .. .. is the one you write about yourself&hellip;
Put yourself out there and write your own story. You may not start out with a book but video logs or social media posts. I&rsquo;d recommend consolidating it at regular intervals via blogs and chapters for phases of your life to finally be compiled into your own version of your story. Just the act of wanting to pack your life densely into a story might encourage you to live a little more adventurously with the drive to give the protagonist a life worth living.
Build your character arc and record it - in hopes of encouraging the future generations to do the same, helping them elevate themselves from the problems you faced by the solutions you consolidated.
As of now, I personally have inspired a handful humans to start writing and the feeling induced when I read their works is that of having created more fellow consolidators that epistemologically forward the world , word by word&hellip;
Hope, this blog adds more to that list. Do let me know about your personal logging pursuits (blogs, art pages, books, video logs) in the comments.

`,content:` Nootropics are cognitive enhancers, boosting brainpower and mental abilities, while ergogenic variants focus on elevating physical performance, creating a powerful combo for unleashing your potential.
I&rsquo;ve got my core habits dialed down now (sleep, exercise, nutrition) and have some good routines in place to actually start converging upon a diet that suits my goal of clocking in stable, moderately high levels of physical and mental performance throughout the day.
I&rsquo;m in a phase now where minor tweaks and changes won&rsquo;t be held back by poor staple habits.
Although numerous reliable recommendations on the ideal stack exist, I&rsquo;m more attracted to conducting fairly controlled experiments - for every human is different in many unidentifiable ways.
Disclaimer This isn&rsquo;t going to be medical advice nor is backed by solid, fairly conducted scientifically rigorous research. It&rsquo;s all anecdotal and I&rsquo;m going to be logging my perspectives on any stuff that I incorporate in my routines.
The Story so Far &hellip; I&rsquo;ve quit caffeine multiple times in the past 5 years only to hop back on when life gets a little too demanding. This time, I&rsquo;ve been off caffeine for around a month and am used to the new stable non-jittery days.
I&rsquo;d also experimented with L-theanine + caffeine in the past (ratio of 200 mg : 100 mg) but I found this to be a non-sustainable way due to a caffeine tolerance buildup over time. Plus I&rsquo;d read Matthew Walker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Why We Sleep&rdquo; some time ago and those memories were enough of an incentive to give up caffeine completely.
I do also cover my bases with a multivitamin and fish-oil and have found them to be effective.
I&rsquo;d also tried an ayurvedic mix of ashwagandha and shilajit with some supplementary ingredients and found that to work pretty well.
And, you may not care about creatine this way, but it&rsquo;s also touted to be a nootropic. And it&rsquo;s cheap, and extremely well researched, and therefore a no-brainer.
Although not a nootropic, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that I do get my choline requirements catered to from 6 whole eggs a day.
I made sure I introduced these independently in a staggered way to avoid confounding influences. Now that I&rsquo;ve dabbled fairly to form a judgment on what suits me, I&rsquo;m hopping on a regular routine for at least a month with a new major experimentation control with a few minor optimizations.
The Current Routine 500mg L-tyrosine, 5 gms of creatine at 5:30 AM pre-workout a 15 min shirtless walk sunbathing sunlight at around 8:00 AM Gotta get that Vitamin D and synchronize my circadian-rhythm like the noble Dr. Huberman would want us to&hellip; multivitamin and fish oil post a large breakfast at 9:00 AM final meal&rsquo;s final bite at 1:30 pm -&gt; on a 6:18 intermittent fasting routine 500 mg ashwagandha and 200 mg L-theanine at night before sleep (around 10:00 pm) I do have a 10 mg melatonin shot reserved for days I wish to reset my cycles or hibernate like a bear over the weekends. with that being said, the best ever nootropic in my experience, is hydrating well - I target around 5 liters a day. The Major Control As you may have noticed, I&rsquo;m testing out L-Tyrosine (a precursor to dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine) this cycle instead of a morning coffee (totally gonna avoid this) + L-theanine stack and will be blogging about my experience with the same upon the next iteration.
The Minor Controls I might work on the ingestion timings a little and how much cardio I do (the runner&rsquo;s high is a real thing). What I do before sleep also affects my rest - I&rsquo;m going to cycle between reading a specific science, philosophy, mathematics, physics, linguistics, listening to a slow non-exciting podcast or just a non-exerting post warm-shower night walk, calling a friend or listening to music.
The PreCondition Although, I&rsquo;m consuming the building blocks for any physical and mental exertion I put myself through, I need to set myself up for a good overnight rest and rejuvenation phase by pushing myself harder and harder each day, in a sustainable manner. This calls for an admirable target as follows:
resistance training 6 days a week + cardiovascular training 3 days (excluding regular walks) at least 5 hours of deep work a day 3-4 hours of shallow administrative and organizational work a day a couple hours of intellectual stimulation (reading and writing does it for me). The PostCondition I hope I feel I&rsquo;ve earned my rest at the end of each day.

`,content:`The Premise I was initially reluctant on using generative AI for my writing process.
That being said, I was quite aware of the potential of large language models (generically addressed as LLMs in here henceforth) - especially true in the case of content creators and/or eccentrically curious individuals.
I, therefore, decided to clarify how I&rsquo;ll be using generative AI for my ideation process.
The Promise Before we get onto that, as promised by the title, distilling the over-arching skills needed to extract good insights from a conversation with an LLM (an el-el-em; please don&rsquo;t read it as large, please..).
Core skills Iteration Follow ups to provide more context to a query can yield good results
you may deliberately start with an open query and narrow it down later on as you receive more info refining already complex queries with minor changes to perfect an output also works Employ the former strat when you&rsquo;re exploring novel ideas; the latter when you wish to dial down on something that you yourself cannot express accurately but can verify a good solution for when you encounter one.
Feedback, the core of iteration, can be broadly categorized as being:
Qualitative/Stylistic request specific changes (usually stylistic) and regeneration specific positive feedback to retain certain aspects in regenerations ask for elaborations ask for independently generated variants Quantitive/Structural request for longer or shorter responses segmenting long form text into concise titles/hooks &ldquo;Act as &hellip;&rdquo; prompts assigning roles can help tweak a perspective or solution according to that particular domain teaching highschool physics vs. writing a scientific excerpt, for instance. providing more context is always better than letting the conversation stay abstract and open ended instead of just being personified into different roles, the LLM may also be asked to mimic a particular interface (a finite state machine that reacts to repsonses in a certain way, for instance) Custom Instructions These are base prompts that direct how the LLM approaches further prompts in a conversation convenient to not have to repeat yourself regarding how you&rsquo;d like to have conversations one may consider stating their daily roles and responsibilities and providing their personal preferences regarding their learning styles What I use personally is as follows -&gt;
What I&rsquo;d like ChatGPT to know about me:
I&rsquo;m a curious individual that doesn&rsquo;t mind having to work out the details about the smallest of phenomena and am interested in going under the hood. For my bachelors, I majored in Computer science and Minored in Artificial Intelligence I&rsquo;m an AI research engineer by profession and wish to improve my expertise in the same - I wish to develop my intuition for the same while building up on the core theoretical and practical demands of the subject. I&rsquo;m also a blogger - I mostly write about stuff that I&rsquo;m currently learning. These may be technical books that I&rsquo;m reading, some tools that I&rsquo;m learning about, some new practical skills that I&rsquo;m logging about. I&rsquo;m open to suggestions about learning new skills that might improve my quality of life and my understanding about the universe in general. I&rsquo;m also not shy to invest time into auxiliary skills that might not explicitly improve my understanding of a domain but may help me be more efficient. Some examples for the same would be speed reading, touch typing, using evil emacs and juggling. I don&rsquo;t mind being challenged on my intellectual perspectives and am always up for a healthy debate. I don&rsquo;t personally prefer implicitly consolidating new axioms and dogmas and would rather like being able to build up the crux of a concept using more primitive, already established and tested theories - This isn&rsquo;t so obvious for the empirical sciences (psychology for instance). I plan to be a commendable polyglot and am linguistics aficionado.
How I&rsquo;d like ChatGPT to interact with me:
Address me as &ldquo;Raj&rdquo; - my name. I&rsquo;d prefer for you to keep your responses concise and not provide me with any filler information unless the lack thereof leads to a gap in my understanding of the domain being discussed. I&rsquo;d like you to converse like a peer that reads diversely and has a healthy sense of skepticism about whatever I say. This goes for you as well and I hope you carefully check your assertions or at least have a disclaimer when you&rsquo;re not sure about whatever we&rsquo;re talking about. Whenever we&rsquo;re discussing a logical problem, I&rsquo;d like you to help my thinking process instead of provide me with answers right away. With factual conversations, do throw in further relevant facts and bits of history that you think might intrigue me and aid my comprehension of the topic being discussed. I&rsquo;m also a technically oriented individual so you may not shy away from using computer programs, math or scientific phenomena to explain even the smallest of queries - I&rsquo;d rather prefer that. Whenever discussing abstract stuff, I&rsquo;d like you to go off-topic a little to keep the conversation engaging and generate new insightful tangents that I could use to philosophize upon myself. Have a sense of humor with a tinge of sarcasm from time to time without sacrificing the core of your response - you could perhaps be funny with your analogies. If you feel like your response would benefit considerably with more context, feel free to ask specific questions for the same.
It works fairly well I&rsquo;d say: here&rsquo;s how a conversation went after I activated these base cues:
ChatGPT, post custom instructions.. Raj what do you think of math and physics in the context of understanding the universe
ChatGPT Ah, math and physics, the dynamic duo of understanding the universe! Raj, you&rsquo;ve hit upon a topic that&rsquo;s as deep as the cosmos itself.
Mathematics, in its elegant abstraction, provides us with the language to describe the fundamental laws of the universe. It&rsquo;s like the blueprint of reality, allowing us to quantify and model everything from particle interactions to the curvature of spacetime.
Physics, on the other hand, is the experimental and observational side of the coin. It&rsquo;s where we test these mathematical models against the real world. It&rsquo;s like the detective work of the scientific world, where we gather evidence from the cosmos to refine and sometimes revolutionize our understanding.
The beauty of this relationship is that math often predicts phenomena before we even observe them, like Einstein&rsquo;s prediction of gravitational waves. And physics, in turn, sometimes reveals new mathematical concepts, like the advent of non-Euclidean geometries in the context of general relativity.
But, here&rsquo;s the twist: while math is often seen as an absolute, physics has its uncertainties. Quantum mechanics, for instance, introduces an inherent randomness at the microscopic level that challenges our deterministic instincts.
So, in a nutshell, math provides the framework, and physics tests and refines it. It&rsquo;s a dance between the abstract and the empirical, a tango of theory and experiment, all aimed at unraveling the secrets of the universe.
Now, feel free to dive deeper into any specific aspect, or let&rsquo;s waltz into another fascinating tangent!
Finishing off with a couple more core skills that could enhance your conversations &hellip;
Instantial duplication all of the previous discussion pertain to zero-shot1 prompts :- the LLM already has stylistic defaults and contextual information regarding the requests and can build the necessary response one shot2 and few shot3 prompts are another class to which the LLM can&rsquo;t satisfactorily respond to without training they simply involve providing one or a few more examples respectively, that are to be kept in mind when the LLM produces a response for the relevant prompt can be used to replicate styles and templates that aren&rsquo;t likely present in the training corpora of the LLM more examples result in better generalization and this may help avoid picking up irrelevant characteristics from one specific example. Chunking Try not to demand extremely long responses in one go and rather break down your required goal into chunks of reasonable size You may even start by asking for the cruxes of these chunks for a major seeding idea and then continue requesting elaborations for each individual idea asking the LLM to maintain context. This is a classical example of &ldquo;Divide and Conquer&rdquo; for the domain of prompt engineering How I plan on using the above Rather than asking the LLM to generate all the content with relatively non-descriptive prompts that give up intellectual control, one can create a better and more involved creation when working iteratively with the LLM and not delegating all aspects of their works completetly.
The ideation process can be sped up via a ping and pong of questions and answers - this goes both ways. You might seed most of the conversation and ask the LLM to deliberately jitter your line of thought occasionally in your custom instructions.
Furthermore, asking the LLM to roleplay might closely replicate the experience of interviewing different individuals and further expand your intellectual coverage of the topic.
My custom instructions also indicate the LLM to state slightly random but still relevant ideas when I&rsquo;m conversing with it. That&rsquo;s like having a pointless chat with a friend over coffee.
The Payoff As a parting note I can see myself using generative AI using it as a well-read assistant that allows you to think freely while it carries the context - seems like a much more intellectually non-handicapping way to go about it.
I won&rsquo;t be using AI generated text in my blogs without a disclaimer/explicit assertion about the same - I got no fomo any mo&hellip;
Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) - ZSL teaches a model to recognize things it has never seen during training by using textual descriptions or attributes.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
One-Shot Learning - In one-shot learning, a model learns to recognize new things with just one example per new thing during training.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
Few-Shot Learning - Few-shot learning helps a model recognize new things with only a handful of examples, usually more than one but still very few.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

`,content:`So, I&rsquo;ve been reading a book on prompt engineering and decided to practice a little&hellip;
Here&rsquo;s a conversation I had with chatGPT regarding a small essay I wrote recently and fortunately, there&rsquo;s room to improve.
Here&rsquo;s how it went&hellip;
Criticize my writing &hellip; Raj: You are my writing critic for this session; do not make any intellectual changes in any text I paste; do not heavily influence my style; only analyze what I say and generate pointers as to how I can become a better writer.
chatGPT: Of course, I&rsquo;ll provide constructive feedback and suggestions to help you become a better writer while respecting your style and content. Please go ahead and paste the text you&rsquo;d like me to review, and I&rsquo;ll provide pointers for improvement.
Raj: The following is an essay I wrote recently, titled &ldquo;The Definitive Guide to Books&rdquo;&hellip;
The Definitive Guide to Books
Books play a pivotal role in the life of any aspiring and existing intellectual. I began reading diversely and seriously when I was 19 and immediately regretted not starting sooner.
Reading sets you up for an involved existence. If you read vastly, you’ll be a force to be reckoned with.
Over the span of 3 years (2019 - 2022), I read around a 100 books ranging from the classics, biographies, auto-biographies, physics, computer science, anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history, how-to-books, nutrition, physiology , fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, business (okay, don’t judge - we all do this), economics, writing, self help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being funny and similar stuff), young adult (only 1 - please don’t chastise me - I could not handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot - please don’t chastise me) and meta books (speed reading, how to consume books, taking notes, etc).
I probably did miss out on some very eccentric oddity that could put me up there in the league of undiagnosed sociopaths - I recited that list based on what I could recall. (I’ve deleted my old goodreads (the one linked is a new index that I’m still building) that had these indexed, for a fresh start -&gt; too many shelves and tags and I’m more of a destroyer than I’m a cleaner).
The habit of reading may have granted me access to the ocean of abstractions and intellectual entities but writing is the guru that teaches you how to swim and dive and evaporate seas and make it rain on deserts and communicate with marine life and unlock secrets from the deepest trenches and generate tsunamis and … well …, yeah …, you get the point..
I have blogged regularly for the majority of my last 4 years of existence and then felt like writing a book after a point. I felt so for the first time a year and a half ago but circumstances (code for excuses and procrastination) did not align the stars for me to get that off my check list.
Yesterday, while cooking my morning post workout feast, in this podcast, Derek (Sivers) discussed the idea of writing a book by building a series of blog posts.
Writing a blog post seems easier than writing down a chapter of similar complexity. It also encourages intermittent feedback rather than a final review of your ideas. I liked the concept and have finally decided to begin writing my book about “The definitive guide to books”.
It should serve as a good entry point for any lexically starved individual (as I was when I began) on how to go about reading diversely, efficiently and consolidating all that you consume in a dense and mentally index-able manner.
The final piece of the puzzle for any bibliophile to graduate into a telepath of abstractions is writing a book. That shall be the final section of my first book and I’ll be collating the experiences of writing these book-oriented blog posts into that final section.
Discussing my plans is a habit that keeps me accountable and pushes me harder on actually sticking to the promise made to no specific individual but to the edges of the internet that won’t be read so easily by those who actually care - that is something I would do: pseudo-accountability taken to the extreme.
“Do let me know what you think of this confession and commitment in the comments below” is a very generic call-to-action I could use, but that doesn’t matter if I actually don’t write the book now.
chatGPT: You&rsquo;ve written an engaging and personal essay titled &ldquo;The Definitive Guide to Books.&rdquo; Here are some pointers to help you improve your writing:
Clarity and Structure: Consider breaking down your essay into clear sections or paragraphs to enhance the overall structure. This will make it easier for readers to follow your thoughts and ideas.
Conciseness: While sharing your personal journey and experiences is valuable, try to be concise and avoid unnecessary repetition. Keep the focus on your main points and insights about books and reading.
Vocabulary and Word Choice: Your essay could benefit from a richer vocabulary. Experiment with more diverse and precise words to convey your ideas effectively.
Sentence Variety: Vary your sentence structure to add rhythm and flow to your writing. This can make your essay more engaging.
Proofreading: Carefully proofread your work for grammar and punctuation errors. For instance, &ldquo;check list&rdquo; should be &ldquo;checklist.&rdquo;
Elaborate on Key Points: When discussing the importance of reading and writing, consider elaborating on specific experiences or examples that illustrate your points. This will make your arguments more compelling.
Tone: Maintain a consistent tone throughout the essay. Your writing style should match the overall mood and message you want to convey.
Engage the Reader: You can enhance reader engagement by asking questions or using rhetorical devices strategically. For example, instead of saying, &ldquo;you get the point,&rdquo; you could elaborate on your analogy to make it more vivid.
Personal Touch: Your personal anecdotes and reflections are a strength of the essay. Continue to weave in your own experiences to connect with readers emotionally.
Call to Action: Your call to action at the end is good, but it could be more specific. Instead of a generic &ldquo;let me know what you think,&rdquo; you could ask for feedback on a particular aspect of your essay or invite readers to share their own book-related experiences.
Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, and with some fine-tuning and attention to these pointers, you can enhance its impact and readability. Keep writing and refining your skills, as practice is key to becoming a better writer.
Raj: I see, what do you think of the tone of the essay as a whole?
chatGPT: The overall tone of your essay is conversational and personal, which can be engaging for readers. It feels like a candid and reflective exploration of your reading journey and your decision to write a book. However, here are some points to consider about the tone:
Consistency: Try to maintain a consistent tone throughout the essay. There are moments when the tone becomes more formal or academic, such as when you mention &ldquo;abstractions and intellectual entities.&rdquo; Make sure the tone aligns with the essay&rsquo;s purpose and target audience.
Engagement: While a conversational tone is relatable, consider adding moments of emotional engagement or passion. Share anecdotes or personal stories that connect with readers on a deeper level.
Clarity: Ensure that your tone doesn&rsquo;t obscure your main points or ideas. Some sentences, like the one discussing writing as &ldquo;unlocking secrets from the deepest trenches,&rdquo; may
be metaphorical to the point of confusion.
Humor: If humor is part of your writing style, feel free to infuse it where appropriate. However, be cautious not to force humor if it doesn&rsquo;t naturally fit the context.
Reader Engagement: Encourage reader engagement and interaction throughout the essay. For example, when discussing your commitment to writing a book, you could invite readers to share their own writing goals or challenges.
In general, your conversational tone is appealing and makes the essay relatable. To enhance it, focus on maintaining consistency and using anecdotes or personal experiences to connect with your audience.
Raj: Hmm, alright. Can you rewrite the whole with the improvements without changing the meaning of the text?
chatGPT: Certainly, here&rsquo;s a revised version of your essay with the suggested improvements in vocabulary and tone while preserving the original meaning:
The Definitive Guide to Books Books hold a vital place in the life of any aspiring or established intellectual. I began my serious and diverse reading journey at the age of 19, and I immediately wished I had started sooner. Reading paves the way for a rich and engaged existence. When you read widely, you become a formidable force. Over three years (2019 - 2022), I devoured approximately 100 books spanning genres from classics and biographies to physics, computer science, anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history, how-to guides, nutrition, physiology, fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, business (yes, we all do this), economics, writing, self-help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being funny and similar content), young adult fiction (only one – please don&#39;t judge – I couldn&#39;t handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot – please don&#39;t judge me), and meta-books (covering topics like speed reading, note-taking, and more). I probably forgot some eccentric gems in that list, but that&#39;s the best I can recall. (I&#39;ve deleted my old Goodreads account, the one linked here is a new index I&#39;m still building - too many shelves and tags, and I tend to destroy rather than clean.) While the habit of reading may have granted me access to the ocean of ideas and intellectual concepts, writing is the guide that teaches you how to navigate these waters. It teaches you to swim, dive deep, make the seas evaporate, rain on deserts, communicate with marine life, unlock secrets from the deepest trenches, and generate tsunamis - well, you get the idea. I&#39;ve consistently maintained a blog for the majority of my last four years, and at some point, I felt the urge to write a book. That urge hit me for the first time about a year and a half ago, but circumstances (which is just a code word for excuses and procrastination) didn&#39;t align to make it happen. Then, during my morning post-workout meal preparation yesterday, while listening to a podcast, Derek (Sivers) discussed the concept of writing a book by creating a series of blog posts. Writing a blog post appears more manageable than crafting a chapter of similar complexity. It also encourages intermittent feedback rather than a final review of your ideas. I found this concept appealing and have finally committed to starting my book titled &#34;The Definitive Guide to Books.&#34; This book should serve as an ideal entry point for anyone craving a richer vocabulary (as I once did) and seeking guidance on how to read diversely, efficiently, and consolidate what they consume into a dense, mentally indexable manner. The final piece of the puzzle for any book enthusiast aspiring to become a master of abstract thinking is writing a book. This will be the concluding section of my first book, where I&#39;ll compile my experiences from writing these book-related blog posts. Sharing my plans is a habit that keeps me accountable and pushes me to stick to my promise, not to any specific individual, but to the corners of the internet that may not be easily reached by those who genuinely care - yes, I tend to take pseudo-accountability to the extreme. Feel free to share your thoughts and comments on this declaration and commitment. Your feedback and engagement will keep me motivated on this writing journey. Raj: Interesting, say you had to score both essays out of 10, what would the scores be?
chatGPT: Both versions of your essay have their strengths, and the scores are subjective, but I can offer an evaluation based on the improvements made:
Original Essay:
Clarity: 7/10 Vocabulary: 6/10 Structure: 6/10 Tone: 7/10 Engagement: 7/10 Revised Essay:
Clarity: 8/10 Vocabulary: 8/10 Structure: 7/10 Tone: 8/10 Engagement: 8/10 The revised essay scores slightly higher in most aspects, particularly in vocabulary and clarity, as it incorporates the suggested improvements. However, the scores are subjective, and what matters most is how well the essay communicates your message and engages your intended audience.

The Unaltered Entry [2022-04-17 Sun 17:09] - 8021 3 hours ago, I encountered a semantic crisis. It all started with the thought that I&rsquo;m not really prepared for a lot of things in life. Now, that in itself is a toxic thought - one can never be prepared for it all but I definitely have time to figure out several things with minimal extra effort. This would definitely result in a lot of uncertainty being cared for. I&rsquo;ve encountered the nihilistic philosophy before: if complete certainty cannot be achieved, why try clearing away any of the uncertainty you have around you.
Well, now I know better: just the fact that you&rsquo;re trying to control what you can, will put you in a much better position when things don&rsquo;t go according to your plan and will render you more capable to figure stuff out.
Undigressing1, this made me think about how dedicated I am to my pursuit of polymathy. I am an etymology nut and the etymology of etymology pertains to the true-sense of a word.
Polymath, arises from the two roots:
&ldquo;poly&rdquo; : pertaining to many &ldquo;mathen&rdquo;: pertaining to learning Therefore, polymathy really means:
being learned in several domains being an expert in several domains being knowledgeable in several domains All these are variations of what I intend to reach - I can never be any of these but only ever tend to them. This holds true even for a single domain - there&rsquo;s always something left to learn. If you&rsquo;ve noticed the times when I&rsquo;ve brought up polymathy, I always say &ldquo;I aspire to be a polymath&rdquo;.
Well, another psychological conflict I have with polymathy is that it has the root word &ldquo;poly&rdquo; - pertaining to many. However, in my post The Polymathic Life, I state that one aspect of the pseudo-polymathic fallacy is seeing all the epistemological structures differently and not unifying them into one big well-connected whole.
Well, the word &ldquo;Polymath&rdquo; is in itself saying otherwise. I have fallen prey to the classical fallacy of not accounting for the mental baggage that already coined words bring with them. If I am not truly in alignment with the word itself, I shouldn&rsquo;t be expecting myself to be subconsciently1 agreeing to dedicate my life to this pursuit.
Then, thanks to the fact that I&rsquo;m a gnomenphomaniac1, I went on to engineer a word, for three hours, that would truly suit what I want to do with my life - so that I would, truly, be subconsciently in on it and not have to encounter any new semantic crises in the future.
Randomly picking up any etymological root from any ancestor wouldn&rsquo;t do me good this time. I wanted to swipe off maximum mental baggage and minimize the connotations that it brings along with it in these times of contemporary languages. I also wanted it to sound somewhat crude and primal - that&rsquo;s just taking care of my personal tastes.
The first major shift I want to make is to include temporality into the picture instead of quantifying how much I know. I can never say I know it all, but I can definitely believe that I&rsquo;m always seeking something.
Secondly, I ask more questions than I have the answers to and that I believe in strongly. I&rsquo;m an inquirer.
Therefore, I do not wish to be the All-Knowing but the Always-Inquiring.
This also helps me tackle the mental hurdle of the word &ldquo;polymath&rdquo; introducing the assumption of epistemology tending to loosely connected structures of different domains and move on to the more beneficial dogma of seeing it all as one big unified whole.
I&rsquo;m an AEFRAISK I derive this from two roots:
[ash]fre : &ldquo;ever&rdquo;/&ldquo;always&rdquo; from Old-English2 aisku : &ldquo;ask&rdquo; from Proto-West-Germanic Note that languages are a way how the community chooses to express the connectivity of several groups of abstractions.
I&rsquo;ve tried choosing the oldest possible ancestors I could get for these roots.
I aspire to be a polymath, no more.
I am an aefraisk, henceforth.
The Commentry I do remember thinking really hard about what I&rsquo;m doing then. Epistemelogy was something that I actively studied those days and was heavily conflicted whenever I used &ldquo;polymath&rdquo; as word that I didn&rsquo;t believe in.
I did give words a lot of importance then. It was a phase that I don&rsquo;t particularly despise nor admire too much. I do find linguistics and its daughter domains quite interesting but if you venture a little too deep, you may implicitly start taking conversations a little too literally and miss out on the joys of a casual chat due to being in constant awe of how the human race came to use a certain phrase over time.
As of now, I believe in using words that exist and will just be more descriptive if I encounter an &ldquo;un-atomically-expressible-notion&rdquo;. Creating your own stuff is cool and all, but it&rsquo;s mostly an unnecessary overhead and I&rsquo;d rather prefer being lexically lean.
AAIN -&gt; this is something I did in my previous blogs : a lot of abbreviations and cooking up new terminology for which I maintained a personal dictionary on the blog itself. AAIN is supposed to be a meta-abbreviation that I don&rsquo;t recall as of now. If a word didn&rsquo;t show up in a dictionary and I felt like using it, I&rsquo;d just add it to my personal glossary - A little imature, I know..&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
&ldquo;ash&rdquo; : � is unicode 00e6, � is unicode 00c6; I use emacs: C-x 8 RET &ldquo;code&rdquo; does the job -&gt; it isn&rsquo;t rendering on the new static site&hellip; replacing all instances with &ldquo;AE&rdquo;&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

The Unaltered Entry [2022-02-23 Wed 18:11] - 7968 A polymath (Greek: πολυμαθής, polymathēs, &ldquo;having learned much&rdquo;; Latin: homo universalis, &ldquo;universal human&rdquo;) is an individual whose knowledge spans a substantial number of subjects, known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems.
For the past 2 years, I&rsquo;ve begun exploring several domains simultaneously, maintaining a generic enthusiasm and curiosity for most of them. Here are some thoughts on what I feel now, actively pursuing polymathy.
The Polymathic Gamble The age-old adage of &ldquo;Jack of all trades, King of none&rdquo; does get to one&rsquo;s head. Over the two years, on several occasions, I&rsquo;ve felt so. Someone who began out parallelly in a particular domain will likely progress faster in the immediate future, given specialized efforts. This is the premise of the gamble.
Another presentation of the gamble, which I would term as the polymathic polylemma, matures as follows: I&rsquo;ve been swayed several times by several attractive choices over how to spend my nights and week-ends - simply a manifestation of one&rsquo;s ravenous intellectual appetite. Albeit, the extent of intellectual discipline required to maintain sanity and tip-toe around the paradox of choice is huge. You definitely don&rsquo;t want to be a thirsty, hungry donkey placed exactly at the midpoint of food and water - dying of both, thirst and hunger.
The Polymathic Edge a.k.a. The Pseudo-Polymathic Fallacy The polymathic edge, I hypothesize, arises from a certain set of revelations - ones that I seem to be in the process of realizing.
A weaker set of assertions that one might start out with could be:
With high likelihood, any two domains share a significant epistemological core.
For a collection of domains, as the number of domains increases, the chances of chancing upon an epistemological region that belongs to a single domain decreases drastically.
Finally, a strong assertion that one could benefit from having faith in would be:
All domains - with certainty - share a huge, generic, insightful epistemological core.
The pseudo-polymathic fallacy, is then to treat all domains with extreme rigidity and forbidding inter-domain linkages. The pseudo-polymath can only progress in one domain at a time.
The pseudo-polymathic fallacy, is then to believe in uni-dimensional tests to be the sole judge of progress. Pragmatic problems, I hypothesize, parallelly, and exclusively, test one over multiple domains. Note that I&rsquo;m not rejecting the validity of uni-dimensional tests as an indicator of progress, but simply conjecturing that they are incomplete. Even a collection of uni-dimensional scores misses out on prominent aspects - explicitly capturing the interaction of those scores (averaging, I feel, is still very primal).
The pseudo-polymathic fallacy, is then to be discouraged by the same age-old adage mentioned in the polymathic gamble - to use that as an excuse to not try &ldquo;novel&rdquo; (novelty is subjective - recall the strong assertion) things, to fear the short-term epistemological lag, to curb your intellectual appetite instead of devouring all that awaits, your devouring. The polymath is aware that any piece of knowledge forwards several frontiers simultaneously.
The polymathic path, seems to be slow at first, with most of the progress going undetected, with your peers visibly progressing faster in that one domain, with you feeling that you&rsquo;re a pseudo-polymath, a dilettante.
Eventually, however, grasping new domains is easier and the snowball gets rolling.
Eventually, greater returns follow albeit the polymath never asked for them - simply tending to the intellectual appetite all the while.
Therefore, I conjecture &hellip;
The pseudo-polymathic fallacy leads to the polymathic edge.
The Commentary A little later, I discovered that the jack and master adage was incomplete and it fully goes as:
Jack of all trades, master of none, is still better than a master of one.
Now,
I&rsquo;d really forgotten this aspect of myself since my last low in life and am only now recalling how I used to carry myself in the past.
It&rsquo;s only been 4 months that I decided to be hyper-ambitious again and now that I&rsquo;ve the basics decently covered again (sleep, exercise, nutrition, and a core work ethic), I do feel it&rsquo;s time to rejuvenate my high intensity pursuits (actively learning several domains - life was very exciting back then and I&rsquo;m going to bring that back).
As with anything I approach, I philosophically sort my intentions out before I begin with the basics. That helps me keep going when the going gets tough and stay true to my intitial philosophical intent of exploring a subject.
In that context, this is a meta-philosophical reasoning for wanting to continue with polymathy. I really had to convince myself : this wasn&rsquo;t a normal life that I was actively choosing to go forward with and would require immense levels of discipline, patience and grit to stay true to that choice.
I&rsquo;m glad I chose so then.
I&rsquo;m choosing so again, now.

The Unaltered Entry [2022-02-01 Tue 10:11] - 7946 I, hitherto, have been reading books as a single unit of intellectual conveyance. However, that strategy doesn&rsquo;t work for all the works. Some authors have their writings crisply intertwined with their other writings.
Approaching a single book as a part of a larger intellectual conveyance is more efficient in the longer term if one intends to read all the work of a particular author. Consequently, grouping these reads together has also been somewhat interesting lately.
The first author that I&rsquo;m reading adhering to this strategy is Nietzsche. On the road to &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve already read &ldquo;Beyond Good and Evil&rdquo;, &ldquo;Twilight of the Idols&rdquo;, and presently consuming &ldquo;Human, all too Human&rdquo;. The next milestones will be &ldquo;Genealogy of Morals&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Antichrist&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Gay Science&rdquo;. Then I&rsquo;ll move on to his reflective works: the &ldquo;Ecce Homo&rdquo; and the posthumous &ldquo;The Will to Power&rdquo; (not exactly reflective, but will be using his notebooks to derive reflective insights). Finally, all this will be put to use for the better understanding of his &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo;. Definitely expecting to grasp him much better than if all this was consumed sparsely. This is one reading cycle: will be revisiting the main works again over the duration of my life.
The Commentary Okay, I actually did end up reading those works in that order up until &ldquo;The Will to Power&rdquo;. It was a slog and worth it. It led to some intricate discussions with an individual I met on trek in the himalayas a year ago -&gt; I was 22 and he was probably in his 40s so there was some life experience at play as well in our conversations. It&rsquo;s rare to find other individuals that are philosophically inclined these days and are willing to put in the work to read books and actually contemplate upon what they read. we had several insightful heated discussions but yeah, what led to that is the fact that we both personally chose to read such books. as a parting note, he recommended I read up on Rumi - the poet. I did put that in my queue and decided I&rsquo;ll get to that when I finish the Nietzschean reading cycle. But &hellip;
stuff rolled downhill post that trek (literally and figuratively) in all aspects and I never got around to finishing the will to power and getting on &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo; (I&rsquo;d already secured the &ldquo;Thus Spoke Syphilis&rdquo; variant) that led to a huge break in my intellectual pursuits (~10 months) and I only recently began caring about piecing my life back together. I began working out and reading again a couple of months ago, writing again a month after that and socially reconnecting with my friends a little while after that. All I can say is that it&rsquo;d been a stagnant year and the temporal river&rsquo;s begun flowing smoothly again fairly recently. that&rsquo;s a little too many adverbs at once. anyway, one such friend of mine brought up the topic of Nietzsche a couple of days ago and that induced this huge recall spree of my past and my plans. so, I&rsquo;ve finally decided to put an end to my first reading cycle of Nietzsche and &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo; has been my bed time read since yesterday. Conclusion What I would like you to take away from this anecdote is:
read good books have good friends that read good books blog, to log your prominent thoughts over time stay true to your promises it&rsquo;s never too late for you to revive your ambition and passion, irrespective of what life has dumped on you Meta Commentary Those were the times when I used to index my days in decimal and would manually keep a count of the same That was also a time when I was critical of timestamping whatever I wrote down : these specifically are org-style timestamps (C-u C-c C-!) as of now, I use an elisp function that does the counting and handles similar utilities. stylistically speaking, there does seem to be an unecessary tinge of complexity and I don&rsquo;t particularly recall forcing that. guess that was just a phase.. words did flow off my fingers pretty fluidly those days&hellip; good times &hellip; addressing the &ldquo;intellectual conveyance&rdquo;&hellip; yeah, that seems a little overboard now Being able to criticize your past works rather than revering them is a sign of progress I guess. Appendix the utility function that I use for hexifying my stream timestamps (defun life-hex-count () &#34;number of days I&#39;ve been alive&#34; (interactive) (let* ((birth (date-to-time &#34;2000-05-01 19:30 IST&#34;)) (today (date-to-time (format-time-string &#34;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z&#34; (current-time)) )) (diff (float-time (time-subtract today birth)))) (insert (format &#34;0x%X&#34; (/ diff 86400))))) (defun hex-ops () &#34;hexify decimal number at point, invoke life hex at count if nil&#34; (interactive) (defun delete-word-at-point () (kill-word 1) (backward-kill-word 1)) (defun valid-number-p (str) &#34;Check if a string is a valid number.&#34; (string-match-p &#34;^[+-]?[0-9]*\\\\.?[0-9]+\\\\(?:[eE][+-]?[0-9]+\\\\)?$&#34; str)) (let ((dec-days (word-at-point))) (cond ((null dec-days) (life-hex-count)) ((valid-number-p dec-days) (progn (delete-word-at-point) (insert (format &#34; 0x%X &#34; (string-to-number dec-days)))) ) I had a log about all these books with reviews in my old good reads stream But&hellip;., I was decided to delete that account for reasons I can&rsquo;t reason for as of now. well, fresh starts aren&rsquo;t that bad after all there&rsquo;s no intellectual baggage, and I don&rsquo;t care what others think of what I read now.. Good reads isn&rsquo;t just another biblio-social media for me and serves merely as an index now -&gt; now that&rsquo;s what I call progress. `,url:"https://rajp152k.github.io/post/reading-an-author/"},"https://rajp152k.github.io/post/refactoring-old-works/":{title:"Refactoring Old Works",tags:["past","work","refactor","archives"],meta:`<article class="list__item post">

`,content:`I&rsquo;d managed to produce some fairly original essays on my last blog and I&rsquo;ll soon be incorporating them into posts here. I had a habit of writing in streams in the main blog itself and there is a lot of insight stored in the chronology of some such logs.
The old blog is archived in the repository here and I could benefit from repurposing old works into the present setup.
I&rsquo;ll mainly be focusing on editing the fluff out, finding what good stylistic knacks I&rsquo;ve accumulated over the years, and rejecting the questionable habits that don&rsquo;t serve me so well.
This will also aid me in developing the much needed habit of intently analysing and editing past works. That is one source of deliberate practice that I could definitely use after this long a break (10 months).

`,content:`Books play a pivotal role in the life of any aspiring and existing intellectual. I began reading diversely and seriously when I was 19 and immediately regretted not starting sooner.
Reading sets you up for an involved existence. If you read vastly, you&rsquo;ll be a force to be reckoned with.
Over the span of 3 years (2019 - 2022), I read around a 100 books ranging from the classics, biographies, auto-biographies, physics, computer science, anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history, how-to-books, nutrition, physiology , fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, business (okay, don&rsquo;t judge - we all do this), economics, writing, self help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being funny and similar stuff), young adult (only 1 - please don&rsquo;t chastise me - I could not handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot - please don&rsquo;t chastise me) and meta books (speed reading, how to consume books, taking notes, etc).
I probably did miss out on some very eccentric oddity that could put me up there in the league of undiagnosed sociopaths - I recited that list based on what I could recall. (I&rsquo;ve deleted my old goodreads (the one linked is a new index that I&rsquo;m still building) that had these indexed, for a fresh start -&gt; too many shelves and tags and I&rsquo;m more of a destroyer than I&rsquo;m a cleaner).
The habit of reading may have granted me access to the ocean of abstractions and intellectual entities but writing is the guru that teaches you how to swim and dive and evaporate seas and make it rain on deserts and communicate with marine life and unlock secrets from the deepest trenches and generate tsunamis and &hellip; well &hellip;, yeah &hellip;, you get the point..
I have blogged regularly for the majority of my last 4 years of existence and then felt like writing a book after a point. I felt so for the first time a year and a half ago but circumstances (code for excuses and procrastination) did not align the stars for me to get that off my check list.
Yesterday, while cooking my morning post workout feast, in this podcast, Derek (Sivers) discussed the idea of writing a book by building a series of blog posts.
Writing a blog post seems easier than writing down a chapter of similar complexity. It also encourages intermittent feedback rather than a final review of your ideas. I liked the concept and have finally decided to begin writing my book about &ldquo;The definitive guide to books&rdquo;.
It should serve as a good entry point for any lexically starved individual (as I was when I began) on how to go about reading diversely, efficiently and consolidating all that you consume in a dense and mentally index-able manner.
The final piece of the puzzle for any bibliophile to graduate into a telepath of abstractions is writing a book. That shall be the final section of my first book and I&rsquo;ll be collating the experiences of writing these book-oriented blog posts into that final section.
Discussing my plans is a habit that keeps me accountable and pushes me harder on actually sticking to the promise made to no specific individual but to the edges of the internet that won&rsquo;t be read so easily by those who actually care - that is something I would do: pseudo-accountability taken to the extreme.
&ldquo;Do let me know what you think of this confession and commitment in the comments below&rdquo; is a very generic call-to-action I could use, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter if I actually don&rsquo;t write the book now.

`,content:`I took this up when I had to setup a bunch of NLP pipelines for work and this does stand true to its name - it is a quick and practical index into approaches, introductory theory and useful libraries for the same.
I don&rsquo;t like reading text books at a stretch due to several reasons:- &ldquo;cross a bridge, when you get to it&rdquo; is something that has stood the test of time for me when it comes to reading practical books. I don&rsquo;t find it useful to read stuff without the doing if that is what the book is intended for.
I have been making notes since the second chapter that are indexed in the sentinel reference of the NLP node in my braindump.
I do plan on returning to complete the rest as and when needed.
Here is an index into the meta data of the book.
I don&rsquo;t rate books anymore and simply post reviews. As of now, I don&rsquo;t find any shortcomings in this book as it does what it says and has been on par with my expectations of being a reasonably theoretical and practical resource to get things running quickly.

`,content:`What makes lisp so unique is the way its code is structured - you definitely can&rsquo;t miss all those parentheses. In this section of the series, I discuss the cause for such a representation and how that makes lisp unique in terms of how it views its code as data as code (aka homo-iconicity).

`,content:`This is an auxilliary post collating resources for the recent video I posted &hellip;
The Pipeline All the ideas, resources that I want to process, any miscellaneous questions I have, are fed into the input-queue in the buffer All the manipulation takes place in these buffers - they&rsquo;re org-files and I use org-roam to maintain the connections whenever a node set ripens and is worth sharing, I write a post or publish a video. It can go both ways : I can force a set into maturity if I wish to publish something specific or I may chance upon a concept when observing connections. Observations I use org-roam-ui to visualize the buffer and check for linkages that might result in something useful. I also want to publish this graph (demonstrated in video) but there&rsquo;s no explicit solution for that yet and I&rsquo;m planning to build one myself with rust and webassembly as a compilation target.
Publishing The buffer is a collection of org-files and is published via maker2413/OrgRoamPublish. Check out the exact process at this similar brain dump.
The main blog is published via hugo and is deployed via github pages.
Both, the buffer and the main blog, are published via github actions that are triggered when I push to their respective repositories.
Youtube is something I&rsquo;m figuring out my style with and don&rsquo;t exactly have formal systems yet to produce consistent output. I hope to converge on a system upon multiple iterations (think at least 20).
Concluding &hellip; The video does give you a quick overview of the pipeline which I hope inspires you to start creating content - given that I&rsquo;m trying to highlight how convenient it is to automate stuff and get in the flow of publishing posts/videos once you have your basics set up.
Do let me know if you see any improvements, conceptual upgrades, or notice any inefficiencies with this pipeline in the comments below&hellip;

`,content:`This is the first in a series of blog posts that follow the educational common lisp series on my youtube channel as an auxilliary.
I&rsquo;ll be summarizing the videos in these blogs and be using these to point to references and additional resources that further elaborate the matter.
This post is about why you should consider learning common lisp and how I intend to execute the plan of building an end to end resource index while simultaneously being able to learn more about the language myself.
Prerequisites I&rsquo;ll be covering the basics while not boring seasoned professionals who might be trying out common lisp for the first time. Therefore the only prerequisites are:
enthusiasm for beginners a little patience on behalf of the experts before we get onto the advanced topics References As for the the rest of the details, the video briefly discusses what your editor should be able to do for a comfortable experience with lisp. More information on how you can proceed can be picked up from this roadmap to common lisp by Steve Losh.
If you really wish to get started right and would not like to defer the hurdle that emacs is (it is worth it though), you may refer this playlist on getting started with emacs from scratch by SystemCrafters.
Once you are comfortable with your editor (remember shortcuts and can philosophically defend your choice), you can move on to setting up your lisp development environment. If you choose emacs, you may proceed with slime or sly.
Now that you&rsquo;re all setup and ready to greet the world, you may want some inspiration for getting into common lisp and there&rsquo;s no place better than the essays of Paul Graham for that.
We&rsquo;re ready &hellip; Before we meet again in the next video, do note that I publish on this main blog and on youtube after my plans and content in the buffer mature. A quick search in the index should indicate what I&rsquo;ve been up to and where I&rsquo;m headed.
Call to collaborate If you&rsquo;re someone who shares the dream of making lisp popular and mainstream so that we can use it for our jobs and don&rsquo;t have to switch to blubs to make a living (without denting its charm of course) , consider contributing to the notes and hit me up via mail or any of the other media I&rsquo;m present on.
Wish you a serendipitous and sexpy future with lisp.

`,content:`[As of 0x213B : 2023-08-17 Thu]
I use emacs for a lot of my daily tasks and spend majority of my time in it. This is a review of some significant components of my init.el
;keyboard all the way (menu-bar-mode -1) (tool-bar-mode -1) (scroll-bar-mode -1) ;I don&#39;t like distractions (setq byte-compile-warnings &#39;(cl-functions)) (setq ring-bell-function &#39;ignore) (setq visible-bell t) I chose the most recently engineered package-management solution when I began with emacs, haven&rsquo;t switched since and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll need to. Migrating from vim, I preferred a configuration file rather than installations via melpa interface. Also, freezing and thawing is cool : exact reproducibility is guaranteed.
;;BOOTSTRAPPING STRAIGHT.EL (defvar bootstrap-version) (let ((bootstrap-file (expand-file-name &#34;straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el&#34; user-emacs-directory)) (bootstrap-version 5)) (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file) (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously &#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el&#34; &#39;silent &#39;inhibit-cookies) (goto-char (point-max)) (eval-print-last-sexp))) (load bootstrap-file nil &#39;nomessage)) (straight-use-package &#39;use-package) (setq straight-path &#34;~/.emacs.d/straight/&#34;) Again, I chose the most well-thought out packages when I began two years ago: I don&rsquo;t particularly know the ins and outs of general but I do know it can do what I wish for elegantly and the proper way
;GENERAL + binding free ups (use-package general :straight t :config (general-unbind &#34;C-M-o&#34; ; free up for org-roam *Notes* &#34;C-M-r&#34; ; free up for remote ops &#34;C-s&#34; ; for super bindings )) I like being greeted by cultish messages and calls to freedom when I get to work. Also serves as an index for the most recently and the most frequently accessed files.
;DASHBOARD (use-package dashboard :straight t :config (dashboard-setup-startup-hook) (general-define-key &#34;C-c h&#34; (lambda () (interactive)(view-buffer &#34;*dashboard*&#34;))) (setq initial-buffer-choice (lambda () (get-buffer &#34;*dashboard*&#34;)) dashboard-center-content t dashboard-startup-banner &#39;logo)) I wouldn&rsquo;t be using emacs if not for this. Modal editing is a must and not using vi keybindings once you&rsquo;re used to them is an extremely questionable way to go about your life.
;EVIL ENV (use-package evil :straight t :init (use-package undo-fu :straight t :config (general-define-key :states &#39;normal &#34;u&#34; #&#39;undo-fu-only-undo &#34;\\C-r&#34; #&#39;undo-fu-only-redo) (setq evil-undo-system &#39;undo-fu)) (setq evil-want-keybinding nil evil-want-integration t) :config (evil-mode 1)) (use-package evil-collection :straight t :after evil :config (evil-collection-init)) (use-package evil-org :straight t :after org :config (general-add-hook &#39;org-mode (list #&#39;evil-org-mode)) (require &#39;evil-org-agenda) (evil-org-agenda-set-keys)) (use-package evil-surround :straight t :config (global-evil-surround-mode 1)) Supercharges any lookup and makes any basic operation much more user friendly.
;HELM (use-package helm :straight t :config (general-define-key &#34;M-x&#34; #&#39;helm-M-x &#34;C-h a&#34; #&#39;helm-apropos &#34;C-/&#34; #&#39;helm-occur &#34;C-x C-f&#34; #&#39;helm-find-files) (helm-mode 1)) Ack&rsquo;ing large directories and getting referenced instances of all occurences of a pattern in a matter of seconds is not bad.
;PROJECTILE (use-package projectile :init :straight t :config (projectile-mode 1) (use-package helm-projectile :straight t :config (general-define-key :prefix &#34;C-c p&#34; &#34;f f&#34; #&#39;helm-projectile-find-file &#34;f d&#34; #&#39;helm-projectile-find-dir &#34;a&#34; #&#39;helm-projectile-ack))) There&rsquo;s an adage going around since I don&rsquo;t know when: This is the last file manager you&rsquo;ll ever need.
;FILE MANAGEMENT : DIRED-X (setq find-file-visit-truename t) (general-add-hook &#39;dired-load-hook (list (lambda () (load &#34;dired-x&#34;) ;; Set dired-x global variables here. For example: ;; (setq dired-guess-shell-gnutar &#34;gtar&#34;) ;; (setq dired-x-hands-off-my-keys nil) ))) Guilty as charged : my emacs isn&rsquo;t vanilla&hellip;
;AESTHETICS (use-package darkroom ;; when reading/writing :straight t) (use-package nimbus-theme ;; a healthy mix all the shades you need to be evil :straight t :config (load-theme &#39;nimbus t)) (use-package beacon :straight t :init (setq beacon-size 60 beacon-blink-when-focused t beacon-blink-when-point-moves-vertically 5 beacon-blink-when-window-changes t beacon-color &#34;#4444bb&#34; beacon-blink-delay 0.2 beacon-blink-duration 0.2) :config (beacon-mode 1)) Hot-reloads and some buffer space to mess around with new components I&rsquo;m testing out.
;QUICK CONFIG (defun edit-init () (interactive) (message (concat &#34;editing user-init-file @ &#34; user-init-file)) (find-file user-init-file)) (defun open-scratch-space () (interactive) (message (concat &#34;opening scratch space @ /mnt/c/Users/Raj Patil/source/scratch&#34; )) (find-file &#34;/mnt/c/Users/Raj Patil/source/scratch&#34;)) (general-define-key :prefix &#34;C-c&#34; &#34;e&#34; #&#39;edit-init &#34;s&#34; #&#39;open-scratch-space) This makes organizing multiple workspaces and panes easy and you&rsquo;re missing out on a lot if you don&rsquo;t have sensible tab-management figured out.
;Window management (use-package window-purpose :straight t :config (purpose-compile-user-configuration) (general-define-key :prefix &#34;C-c ,&#34; &#34;d&#34; #&#39;(lambda () (interactive) (message &#34;dedicating current window&#34;) (set-window-dedicated-p (selected-window) t)) &#34;u&#34; #&#39;(lambda () (interactive) (message &#34;undedicating current window&#34;) (set-window-dedicated-p (selected-window) nil)))) The self-documenting editor in action&hellip;
;WHICH-KEY (use-package which-key :straight t :config (which-key-mode) (general-define-key &#34;C-h C-k&#34; #&#39;which-key-show-top-level) (which-key-setup-side-window-bottom)) I prefer reading technical texts right within emacs besides my notes..
;PDF INTEROP (use-package pdf-tools :straight (pdf-tools :host github :repo &#34;vedang/pdf-tools&#34;) :config (pdf-loader-install)) Magical Git : I haven&rsquo;t used this in a while and mostly use the eshell interface for basic stuff but I can vouch for the unparalleled experience it provides in terms of executing even the most complicated operations with a few chords and strokes. Now that&rsquo;s Magit.
If you like the the interface in itself and would like to implement a similar functionality for your extensions, checkout Transient or Hydra
;MAGIT (use-package magit :straight t) Well, enough can&rsquo;t be said about this. All of it can be documented though&hellip;&hellip;.., right&hellip;&hellip;?
Do note that you might need to checkout a specific commit of org-mode if you also wish to use org-roam (some recent releases are breaking and I personally am not aware of exactly what breaks what stuff..).
The tag line should be enough to hook you:
your life in plain text.
If it isn&rsquo;t, you probably are the kind of person that uses the mouse a tad too much and many programmers - along with me - will be judging you hard for that.

`,content:`Given I&rsquo;ve passed through SICP once, quickly grasping common lisp to build stuff and explore the traditional and industrial aspects of lisp (I know clojure exists but traditional&hellip;) was my next objective: with decent speed and only solving the somewhat involved exercises, it took me two weeks to complete this book.
The exercises aren&rsquo;t meant to be a challenge but to adapt to the environment and the topics introduced. The book does not explore concepts with depth (CLOS, macros, etc&hellip;) but that shouldn&rsquo;t be the objective of an introduction anyway.
This is a good stepping stone to get started with common-lisp if you&rsquo;ve already dipped your toes into a scheme (I did SICP with Racket). When picking this up as your first experience with lisp, I&rsquo;ll recommend completing all the exercises and not skimming as I did.
On that note, the next book that I&rsquo;m tackling is &ldquo;Practical Common Lisp&rdquo;. I do maintain active notes of anything that I learn, on my braindump and a quick search in the index should highlight all the technical details.

`,content:` There&rsquo;s a better way to do it - Find it.
Thomas Alva Edison
Managing one&rsquo;s intellectual appetite in these times of information (and noise) excess is quite an ordeal. Given superior tooling and methods to plough through dense knowledge forests, coming up with the right set of tools for oneself is still a commendable task. In this post, I sketch out how one could go about making such choices practically, from why you should bother, to what tangible actions you can get started with.
Pre-requisites The following is of no use to you if you aren&rsquo;t a little info-hungry and are just the &ldquo;when I cross that bridge&rdquo; guy : any pursuit today requires maintaining efficient intellectual pipelines and I hope this isn&rsquo;t an after-thought for you.
With that out of the way, &hellip;
Why bother .. .. finding the best tools and methods for your needs when generic-solutions are good-enough and allow you to get started without an extensive setup?
I&rsquo;d say this is a short term play and doesn&rsquo;t take into account the future you&rsquo;s convenience. You might get a project&rsquo;s knowledge base maintained via one set of principles but that&rsquo;s not the only one you&rsquo;ll do throughout your life. You might wish to port ideas between projects maintained with different methods or would even like to maintain generic notes that don&rsquo;t fit any project. It&rsquo;ll be a large unelegant mess if you don&rsquo;t actively invest some effort into getting things right before you begin. Although it might slow you down for the sprint, you&rsquo;ll be better off in the marathon. Efficiency in the wild isn&rsquo;t about linear progress but phases of waxing and waning. You might ultimately reach a ceiling that is way beyond your expectations from when you started out. You&rsquo;ll have your past self&rsquo;s grit and obsession with productivity to thank for then. However, rather than going all out right away, easing into this idealogy of a controlled obsession will keep you in the game longer.
Before proceeding towards the specifics, understanding &hellip;
.. When .. .. to cash in your profits and cut down on your proverbial &ldquo;time&rdquo; loss is tricky to figure out - you might fall for the trap that sophisticated procrastination is. I personally prefer learning aggressively during rests between major projects and then incorporating what meta-skills I learned actively into the next project. These intermittent consolidation phases give me a break from what would otherwise be a pretty boring and unidimensional intellectual life.
What .. .. core activities should you focus on when getting started with this pursuit?
Text Well, text is the common medium that can represent all that we wish to, with considerable completeness. An image might be better suited to certain individuals dependent on their work but text is complete and more potent than images. Relevant charts and graphs can be easily generated with minimal code which is more efficient than touching the mouse (eg: mermaid with org-babel).
I&rsquo;d suggest being digital all the way for your over-all store than having some hand-written notes due to obvious reasons. Quills and parchments (and derivatives thereof) are romantic, no doubt, but highly impractical. When completely digital, you have the opportunity of setting up custom pipelines and triggers between tools if you wish to be a little more serious in this endeavor.
Basic IO On the context of digitizing your knowledge forest, optimizing your interaction with computers and documents with some meta skills like speed reading (for screens and not just books) and touch typing might be a decent choice.
I personally invested around 45 mins a day for 40 days following the book &ldquo;Breakthrough rapid reading&rdquo; by Peter Kump around two years ago. I sped up from 200 wpm to 500 wpm for moderately complex material without sacrificing comprehension. As of now, without practice, I can lazily achieve 400 wpm simply due to the habits I learned then. When I&rsquo;ve slept well and focus explicitly, I might even clock in a respectable 800 wpm.
As for touch typing, you may refer any one online platform that demands a relatively measly 10 minutes of practice a day for around a month : from this point forth, you&rsquo;ll be proficient enough at this point that you don&rsquo;t need to explicitly carve out time to practice touch typing. This is an important step as you&rsquo;d definitely be ditching the mouse soon, given you like speed. You can expect speeds of upto 100 wpm when cognitively fresh. You&rsquo;ll probably never be thinking this fast when programming.
Albeit, It&rsquo;s good to ensure that you aren&rsquo;t IO bound when note-taking/generating drafts when reading technically dense material.
Editing Now that you love keyboards and text, I&rsquo;d suggest you learn vi (even if you use vanilla emacs) and get pretty good at it: vim was my main dev and intellectual ecosystem (with the unix utilities) for around 18 months and I&rsquo;d recommend you have a few main goals when doing so:
understand the philosophy of modal editing and the semantics for specific binds (most of them are pretty intuitive). understand why you&rsquo;d like to customize your setup and what are the limits of something that looks so basic and is decades old (I was personally amazed initially as to why ancient software (without extreme philosophical upgrades) is still in active use and development today (referring to vim and emacs)). Some resources that I used if you&rsquo;d like to explore this a bit further:
a search on how to quit vi the inbuilt help system and vimtutor (:help ... &lt;RET&gt;) https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/ Vi pays off that initial investment in dividends every day till the day you stop using a computer. I use evil emacs, vim keybindings in my gui browsers, within VS code when I need a quick temporary dev setup for work and the first thing I check for any programmer oriented tool is if it follows a similar modal philosophy and doesn&rsquo;t force the mouse on me.
If you&rsquo;ve reached this point, you&rsquo;re already pretty satisfied with yourself and may consider thinking you&rsquo;ve found your sweet comfy efficiency optimum for eternity. Well .., fortunately .., you haven&rsquo;t. You might still be relying several distinct pieces of programs to get stuff done, held together with generic glue that isn&rsquo;t aware of what you&rsquo;re doing or is based on assumptions you explicitly assert anywhere&hellip; This is the time you should start thinking about having a cohesive &hellip;
Ecosystem Context switching between different tools is a pain and for the next big leap, you need something to be able to bring it all together in a neat, sophisticated package - a unifying philosophy that doesn&rsquo;t just works - it hypnotizes you into its doctrines. I found my unifying ecosystem 2 years ago with emacs and I&rsquo;ve never regretted that initial lack of productivity incurred when porting my work environment from vim.
This post isn&rsquo;t meant to describe the tooling in depth but just serve as an index, as a potential roadmap&hellip;
With that being said, I will be posting a lot about Emacs in the future and how I use it - I&rsquo;ll take you as my padawan and be glad to initiate you to the dark side.
Now that you&rsquo;re equipped to blaze past all those blogs, papers and the internet, you should stop and consider ..
.. Whether .. .. you should be consuming all that you do. Most of the noise (aka news) is shoved down your throat and isn&rsquo;t a choice. Some primitive steps you can employ to avoid choking from whatever falls upon your retina and ear drums:
be disciplined in your pursuits : there is a fine line between curiosity and being distracted -&gt; I struggle with this from time to time and have only recently grasped what balance is. delegate the work of finding quality content to the wisdom of the crowds (stabilize your sources: I use https://news.ycombinator.com/ and RSS(really simple syndication) for some specific sources) Conclusion With all that I&rsquo;ve indexed, I hope this post inspires you to look at your consumption/creation pipelines in a new light and sparks the same enthusiasm I harbor towards regularly sharpening the proverbial intellectual axe - do chop away : I&rsquo;d be glad to read about your epistemological anvils and furnaces.

`,content:` If you wish to be a writer, write. Epictetus
A Brief History I took up writing as a hobby in the sophomore year of my bachelors and it turned out to be the most definitive step towards bettering my way with words and expressing myself accurately.
This is the fourth major iteration on my blogging system and I&rsquo;ve noticed that I&rsquo;m slowly tending towards minimalism and an overall clutter-free approach with each step, building up from my past stylistic mistakes and experiences. As with any beginner, I began with enthusiasm and held my ideas in high regard - a major reason for why I felt they should be out there. Over time, as I read more, I learned I had a lot more to learn and finally after a long break of writing frequently, here I am again, at symbolic ground zero - drafting a first post.
In my last major writing phase, I did so solely for myself. While enjoyable for as long as that lasted, one can&rsquo;t continue to write ,without a definite purpose, without exhausting enthusiasm. An external indicator of progress is necessary to measure oneself, in absence of which, one could beat around the bush for eternity, accumulating works of mediocre caliber. My last system was more inclined towards the notion of &ldquo;logging&rdquo; than that of writing and was lacking discipline - progress was slow and wasn&rsquo;t explicitly observable: it was a rather naïve approach towards building an online presence other than a social media profile. By the end of it, I was even creating my own words (thanks to my etymological interests) that I had to maintain records in an appendix: such actions added to the esoteric nature of my intellectual interests : making whatever I published less accessible to the common folk.
The Present I am picking up the symbolic quill (I&rsquo;m typing of-course) after a mental rock-bottom and inactivity (mental and physical) of roughly a year.
As I begin to re-enter the world and get back to trying to be an adult, I wish to establish systems that will help me document the lessons while building myself up again.
I like reading (another literary habit that&rsquo;s on par with writing that took a hit this past low) - be it practical or non-fictional abstracts (I still don&rsquo;t do fiction). Remembering what I&rsquo;ve read is more important than racing through books and writing is something that explicitly helps me with:
applying stylistic lessons from works that I consume actually consolidating what I read and not just collect completions as trophies but as an evolving node in a malleable knowledge network. To explicitly segregate these objectives so that I can work on them independently, I&rsquo;ve sectioned the latter in the buffer subdomain of my website accessible via the brain dump tab above.
Any time I wish to add to/prune/manipulate the knowledge network, I can do so without worrying about how it&rsquo;s presented, while also being able to practice presenting my thoughts well on the main blog.
Elaborating .. Maintaining a good writing pipeline is essential to automate the process of generating content. In my past endeavours, the process involved the phases of :
planning drafting editing posting This linear process fails to capture how a writer might really think when formulating prose. One would like having convenient access to past works for relevant links and editing is not really a one-and-done job but an iterative process&hellip;
Moreover, this makes blogging a versioned process, rather than a living, breathing organism (the sect of lispers might know where I pick this up from) that more closely follows your thoughts, maturing over time.
This also makes you believe that each post is an independent project in itself and discourages linkages with existing works.
I intend to improve upon this process with this setup of decoupling my notes and what I publish.
I have two major objectives (implicitly interdependent) associated with my online presence on the main blog and the buffer:
To write for myself To write for others Both are important aspects towards being good writer and need to be independently catered to so as to not deter my proficiency in the other.
The buffers will be a personal brain dump where I won&rsquo;t care about formalizing my notes and any other necessities of published works. They will be shorter and linked to other buffers. The main blog will be a formalized projection of multiple inter-related buffers into one serialized output : a snapshot of the living, breathing organism that I intend the buffers to evolve into.
Here we go again&hellip; This time around, I do feel relatively wiser and a little more tempered than when I first began. Quite excited to know as to what I achieve with a fresher but slightly more mature perspective than I had 4 years ago.
