`,content:`Some-days, I wonder that I&rsquo;m born half a millennia too late into this world given the extent of novel societal tendencies that I&rsquo;m not fond of.
Although, the notion of Batman didn&rsquo;t exist then, given a choice, I&rsquo;d probably consider time traveling to an intellectually simpler life when much of what the present science and engineering entails was just beginning to be discovered and invented.
Research options then weren&rsquo;t thresholded by who&rsquo;s packing heavier compute but rather open to all that could observe patiently and portrayed the will to ask, sceptic-ize and act according to their whims.
On the shoulders of Giants&hellip; In the earlier days of most subject, huge anchors of contributions originate from a series of fundamental minor observations, to now forking into numerous finer threads that tangibly realized in the growing amounts of research corpus these days.
The idea of conducting personal research and devising minor domains is continuously being limited to a select few over the decades as apprentices struggle to catch up with finer and finer bleeding edges of something that was so blunt and casually approachable a few hundred years ago.
Although this signifies a growth in complexity of abstractions that humanity has explored as a collective, it does seem to be a gloomy scenario for the curious observer bounded by his natural instruments of observation.
The chances of discovering even the remotest of abstractions independently are ruined by hyper-connected populations. The chances of chancing upon the same intellectual abstraction twice from different roots have dwindled down to none thanks to the power of the written word and lately, computer networks.
A Proposition - Cyber-Solitude One possible panacea for this diverse set of intellectual deficiencies that&rsquo;s forced upon dwellers of the current times, that I&rsquo;ve been testing out is to deliberately distance myself from news and assume a particular thought hasn&rsquo;t been thought of before even though there&rsquo;s a high chance it has been, several times. It might even be recorded in some corners of the internet and be conveniently accessible due to LLMs slowly replacing search engines.
Moreover, not reading up the ends of a thread and only restricting yourself to foundational reads, forcing a rewarding climb up the trees of knowledge to the particular section of a canopy you were searching for is a preferable path for me than observing a snapshot of the same from a satellite zoom-in.
I&rsquo;m not Bad-Mouthing Intellectual Interdependence &hellip; &hellip; but there&rsquo;s a pretty obvious and distinct line between riding a jet across continents and what the wright brothers did over the span of a green field.
While I can&rsquo;t deny the usefulness of the former, I hope you are lucky enough to realize the joy of doing something similar to the latter.
Pseudo-Originality Personally, I&rsquo;ve found trying to come with non-optimal explanations of phenomena around me before looking up the tested and accurate versions to be a fulfilling habit that might just help me retain my sanity and feed my need for natural novelty than drown myself in readily available facts and factoids.
This isn&rsquo;t a jab at collaborative science but a call to independently practice the solitary variant of the same. Both present a different sort of satisfaction that might just be the combination needed for a balanced intellectual diet.

`,content:`Two days ago I found myself scrolling mindlessly for half an hour and I decided I need to decide for real as to how I&rsquo;m going to deal with this issue.
The problem with such a habit is that it is very convenient, engaging and it slices into precious time that I&rsquo;d rather spend doing something more difficult and rewarding like reading.
While devising a strategy to deal with this behaviour, I concluded that videos themselves (long and short form) are the culprit to these new time sinks that I&rsquo;ve been experiencing.
Another neural bait that cyber/social attention engineers employ to capture my attention is the use of vivid colours and forcing unnecessary notifications in places where I&rsquo;d simply prefer getting in, completing a specific task and getting out. For this very reason, I hate youtube and instagram for integrating shorts into the main application and not allowing a way to disable them.
Given I plan to create content based on my interests, I cannot do away with these platforms completely.
A few decisions I&rsquo;ve taken for damage control given the inevitability of the need to be on such platforms for content creators are as follows:
Limit usage to specific times of the day and only if I want to post something, never to consume content I listen to most of my podcasts on spotify and fallback to youtube only in cases I needed something more peculiar always read up first before I watch a video describing the same : always prefer text - It&rsquo;s faster and more precise for me. the alternative is just me being lazy and I&rsquo;d rather relax than watch something of importance lazily. Using my phone in grayscale mode at all times : this is a life-saver, my eyes have never felt so well rested (It&rsquo;s been more than a week now). building a habit of reading on my phone rather than scrolling : this is a relatively more demanding ask and has to be dealt with strategically.. I maintain around half a dozen active reads (all ebooks) at a time so that I can read according to my whims and am not stuck to a specific kind of content at all times of the day. Be patient, and meditate mathematically and philosophically, on my environment, playing my own mental games. Not pulling out the phone during the smallest of breaks is another useful habit. If I do have to consume a long form video, I&rsquo;ll add it to watch laters and only listen to the audio during walks or commutes. If it is important, written sources will always exist and should be preferred over videos. Limit instagram usage to my desktop; again only to post content regarding my content creation pursuits. All the important people in my life have my cell number accessible. being okay with being bored - This is a superpower. Consuming mostly text throughout my day does help with not overstimulating my mind.

`,content:`I&rsquo;ve been building up my vimrc again because emacs&rsquo; tramp mode just wasn&rsquo;t cutting it when it came to speed for my remote work environments.
I&rsquo;ve been a vim user for around 4 years now and having read some books partially and sampling a lot of blogs and conference recordings over this span, I decided I should commit and formally invest into a definitive resource to get me upto speed and beyond.
I&rsquo;d began Learn vim the hard way before I shifted to emacs fulltime but I decided emacs lisp was much better than learning vimscript for a longer time horizon.
I definitely am not leaving emacs anytime soon. All my writing and personal projects will be hosted by evil gccemacs and will only be using vanilla vim + tmux setup for python, shell and relevant data science oriented utilities on my remote setup.
So, Given my hyper-enthusiastic personality when it comes to reading everything before I begin with something : I decided to read the book Learn vim the smart way.
I learned a lot in 4 dense days (everything before 0x217B (inclusive) pertains to comments in the book) and was blown away by some pretty neat peculiarities as well.
I would say that all the CLI interaction made me reminisce about my sophomore year in university when I was in awe of the terminal and first began blogging in a minimal setup with markdown files via jekyll in vim: this was a few months before the pandemic I believe. Blogging and the terminal is what kept me intellectually ticking.
Emacs did come in later on because I considered my options to upgrade my productivity:
learn a whole bunch of unix utilities to fully exploit vim (command mode, etc) learn one unified software that can do everything and more Plus, the affinity of the parenthesis made it pretty easy to choose.
Getting back to the point, I&rsquo;ve setup a minimal dot file right now that allows me get things done without much overheads.
I don&rsquo;t particularly miss being out of emacs, I consider I&rsquo;m mature enough now (I would definitely throw a tantrum a couple years ago) to not associate work with the tool but just get things done.
I mean, I still do use evil emacs and learning about the core of vim more would still level up my editing game, so its not really a equal comparison. Emacs still does encompass everything.
For instance, just one of the many new things I realized from this productivity fiasco (exaggerating) is that vim macros and registers are just different interpretations of the same underlying data structure.
Macros are code and Registers are the source of fetching instructions of that code.
The craziest thing I&rsquo;ve done recently is write a contorted recursive macro by debugging it by printing it as contents of a register and yanking the updates, post editing into the same variable to test it out as a macro again, only to repeat until success.
Need I say more&hellip;, the day I started out editing text in VS code in freshman year, I never thought I&rsquo;d be able to be so lazy in the future when it comes to manipulating programs: thanks to the book, I&rsquo;m thinking much more and moving much less than I used to 4 days ago.

`,content:`I&rsquo;ve decided to increase my frequency of writing on the main blog to get more reps in and converge onto my style quickly than if I continued with long form content only.
I&rsquo;m also going to practice being more concise, and blogging a little more on technical aspects as well.
My usual blog post goes to around 1500-2000 words and that isn&rsquo;t helpful for covering some minor writing prompts I&rsquo;d like to explore.
Long form content helps build up context but sometimes I&rsquo;d just like talking about an idea and seed an intrigue into the readers' minds. Writing about how stuff can be done is interesting but pushing readers to ponder upon certain topics seems more fulfilling to me. Writing, I believe, is inherently about sharing ideas and not just sharing solutions to definite problems.
Around 2 weeks ago, I&rsquo;d brainstormed around 20 such shorter prompts during a night walk post dinner and I really enjoyed the idea of elaborating upon them in these posts.
Being precise is a skill that I actively want to work on and I find such posts to be the perfect candidate to build my planning and structuring habits when it comes to conveying something succinctly and convincingly.
Getting better at rhetoric is, in my belief, something everyone should keep in mind, as it is a fundamental skill applicable to all forms of communication
This blog post was created during a free-flowing writing session and has taken no more than 10 minutes of my effort with another 5 minutes of refactoring and editing.
All such posts will be tagged as a microessay henceforth to notify you of the effort I&rsquo;ve put in.

`,content:`I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a denser review of such a technical and diverse domain. It&rsquo;d been more a year since I graduated (majored in computer science and minored in artificial intelligence) and so I decided to brush up on some basics and consolidate what I&rsquo;d studying since the past ~4 years.
I also picked up the book to systematically populate my org-roam buffer and have my root node rooted here in the braindump.
Do note that I avoid noting concepts down verbatim and always try to write stuff down the way I&rsquo;d like to formulate it for my future self.
This is the official distribution site of the book: https://themlbook.com/
I wouldn&rsquo;t particularly recommend this for beginners (a more pedagogically friendly course is a better intro to such a dense field : I personally began properly with the Fast.AI series but there&rsquo;s many more respectable intros out there) but would rate it as an extremely useful revision index into the domain.
When researching/working in the industry, one usually delves into a particular subdomain. That&rsquo;s necessary and all but this book did help me in forming a better bigger picture of the field and did so very quickly to be honest : I log my work sessions with the org-mode timing system and it took me around 14 hours to read the book from end to end while formulating my notes in the brain dump.
I do want to get onto some more academically inclined reads soon - a little busy with work and personal pursuits as of now to continue with a dense and large read right away.

`,content:` To know thyself, is the beginning of wisdom
Socrates
On tangibility of the past All of us create content, every moment, tuned to varying extents of influence and permanence.
It&rsquo;s intent that separates us all into different leagues of producers.
Let me explain via a hierarchical build up of selected formats of content with varying intensity.
Note that the list isn&rsquo;t exhaustive by any means and I&rsquo;ve deliberately excluded works of larger scale (movies, video games : they have the potential to be the most influential kind of content out there).
Memories: Personal reflections for self, minimal intent beyond preserving moments.
Photos and Videos: Captured experiences for personal enjoyment and sharing with friends and family, moderate intent for preserving and sharing life highlights.
Journal Entries: Personal thoughts for self or select readers, growing intent for self-expression.
Social Media Posts: Daily updates for social circles, moderate to high intent for sharing moments.
Vlogs: Video diaries for followers, moderate to high intent for personal connection.
Podcasts: Audio discussions for niche or general listeners, moderate to high intent for sharing insights.
Blogs: Knowledge sharing for a diverse online audience, high intent for educating and engaging.
Books: In-depth guides for readers, high intent for sharing expertise.
Autobiography: A comprehensive life story for readers, high intent for sharing a personal journey.
These are tangible realizations of indices into our past. There also exist psychological indices that one creates when that don&rsquo;t completely fall into the category of being a memory: working on a project for a long time, so much so that it becomes a part of your life temporarily and allows you to recall exactly how the days passed when working on it.
Serves me well, this pursuit &hellip; For me, reading books with a definite purpose suited to my learning pursuits has been such a strong creator of psychological indices that I could recite my lifestyle when I was reading a particular book and what unique characteristic was different about my life then.
Around two years ago, I remember being able to recite and consolidate my days during all the hundred diverse books I&rsquo;d read when I crossed that checkpoint.
It was a revelation. I wasn&rsquo;t aware that I had the ability to remember so densely, something that hadn&rsquo;t been physically recorded.
That was the first time I understood the power of consuming and creating content with intent.
I began blogging again recently and I&rsquo;d forgotten some major aspects of my life post a minor rough patch. I read my old blogs some while ago and I was able to recall the characteristics of my old self, all the philosophical ramblings I&rsquo;d already progressed with and all the metaphysical checkpoints my personality had achieved.
That wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible hadn&rsquo;t I been blogging regularly for the major half of my bachelors. I was able to capture the most formative years of my life and record the psychological adaptations and growth through it.
It wasn&rsquo;t just the blogs, but all the activities that were done with intent that created such strong indices that allowed me to be more self-reflective and be able to know myself better. The habit of blogging only serves as a maturing agent of sorts, consolidating and solidifying these malleable memories.
If not for the habit of blogging, I still would do a lot of the things I did but I would be a completely different person for the nature of my consolidation phases would&rsquo;ve been comparatively fluffier.
What chapter? Your unaltered perspective about your own life ,captured at regular, frequent instances will probably produce a fairly noisy and jittery signal. The past is what actually stabilizes your perception of your present and highlights probable trajectories for your future.
Your absolute past is definite and no one&rsquo;s ever aware of the complete truth (what is that really?). Your perception of your past, however, is again a variable that is dependent on your noisy present. If you&rsquo;d like being anchored to a specific trajectory or at least have a stable outlook towards uncertainty for your future. I&rsquo;d consider imparting some inertia to your perceptions.
Writing (maintaining journals, for starters) is definitely the perfect tool in your arsenal which requires deliberate focus. It gives you the option to be extremely intentional with what you put down in words.
Even if you have a noisy present, penning down a page or two about what&rsquo;s on your mind rids you of the noise that allows you to get on with actually extracting what really needs to be captured.
I&rsquo;d put it right alongside a long music-free run at the crack of dawn - after the initial grind and post finding the groove it frees you of your intense emotions and your irrational biases, allowing you to think appropriately, as life always demands (being care-free is a luxury not many of us can afford).
With this inertial anchor of perspectives at your disposal, you can lay down a path of breadcrumbs from your past into your present, making your personality&rsquo;s progress tractable.
It helps you structure past chapters in your life, while planning for future ones robustly which is quite the superpower any protagonist would enjoy while formulating their own story.
The most important book you&rsquo;ll ever read .. .. is the one you write about yourself&hellip;
Put yourself out there and write your own story. You may not start out with a book but video logs or social media posts. I&rsquo;d recommend consolidating it at regular intervals via blogs and chapters for phases of your life to finally be compiled into your own version of your story. Just the act of wanting to pack your life densely into a story might encourage you to live a little more adventurously with the drive to give the protagonist a life worth living.
Build your character arc and record it - in hopes of encouraging the future generations to do the same, helping them elevate themselves from the problems you faced by the solutions you consolidated.
As of now, I personally have inspired a handful humans to start writing and the feeling induced when I read their works is that of having created more fellow consolidators that epistemologically forward the world , word by word&hellip;
Hope, this blog adds more to that list. Do let me know about your personal logging pursuits (blogs, art pages, books, video logs) in the comments.

`,content:` Nootropics are cognitive enhancers, boosting brainpower and mental abilities, while ergogenic variants focus on elevating physical performance, creating a powerful combo for unleashing your potential.
I&rsquo;ve got my core habits dialed down now (sleep, exercise, nutrition) and have some good routines in place to actually start converging upon a diet that suits my goal of clocking in stable, moderately high levels of physical and mental performance throughout the day.
I&rsquo;m in a phase now where minor tweaks and changes won&rsquo;t be held back by poor staple habits.
Although numerous reliable recommendations on the ideal stack exist, I&rsquo;m more attracted to conducting fairly controlled experiments - for every human is different in many unidentifiable ways.
Disclaimer This isn&rsquo;t going to be medical advice nor is backed by solid, fairly conducted scientifically rigorous research. It&rsquo;s all anecdotal and I&rsquo;m going to be logging my perspectives on any stuff that I incorporate in my routines.
The Story so Far &hellip; I&rsquo;ve quit caffeine multiple times in the past 5 years only to hop back on when life gets a little too demanding. This time, I&rsquo;ve been off caffeine for around a month and am used to the new stable non-jittery days.
I&rsquo;d also experimented with L-theanine + caffeine in the past (ratio of 200 mg : 100 mg) but I found this to be a non-sustainable way due to a caffeine tolerance buildup over time. Plus I&rsquo;d read Matthew Walker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Why We Sleep&rdquo; some time ago and those memories were enough of an incentive to give up caffeine completely.
I do also cover my bases with a multivitamin and fish-oil and have found them to be effective.
I&rsquo;d also tried an ayurvedic mix of ashwagandha and shilajit with some supplementary ingredients and found that to work pretty well.
And, you may not care about creatine this way, but it&rsquo;s also touted to be a nootropic. And it&rsquo;s cheap, and extremely well researched, and therefore a no-brainer.
Although not a nootropic, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that I do get my choline requirements catered to from 6 whole eggs a day.
I made sure I introduced these independently in a staggered way to avoid confounding influences. Now that I&rsquo;ve dabbled fairly to form a judgment on what suits me, I&rsquo;m hopping on a regular routine for at least a month with a new major experimentation control with a few minor optimizations.
The Current Routine 500mg L-tyrosine, 5 gms of creatine at 5:30 AM pre-workout a 15 min shirtless walk sunbathing sunlight at around 8:00 AM Gotta get that Vitamin D and synchronize my circadian-rhythm like the noble Dr. Huberman would want us to&hellip; multivitamin and fish oil post a large breakfast at 9:00 AM final meal&rsquo;s final bite at 1:30 pm -&gt; on a 6:18 intermittent fasting routine 500 mg ashwagandha and 200 mg L-theanine at night before sleep (around 10:00 pm) I do have a 10 mg melatonin shot reserved for days I wish to reset my cycles or hibernate like a bear over the weekends. with that being said, the best ever nootropic in my experience, is hydrating well - I target around 5 liters a day. The Major Control As you may have noticed, I&rsquo;m testing out L-Tyrosine (a precursor to dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine) this cycle instead of a morning coffee (totally gonna avoid this) + L-theanine stack and will be blogging about my experience with the same upon the next iteration.
The Minor Controls I might work on the ingestion timings a little and how much cardio I do (the runner&rsquo;s high is a real thing). What I do before sleep also affects my rest - I&rsquo;m going to cycle between reading a specific science, philosophy, mathematics, physics, linguistics, listening to a slow non-exciting podcast or just a non-exerting post warm-shower night walk, calling a friend or listening to music.
The PreCondition Although, I&rsquo;m consuming the building blocks for any physical and mental exertion I put myself through, I need to set myself up for a good overnight rest and rejuvenation phase by pushing myself harder and harder each day, in a sustainable manner. This calls for an admirable target as follows:
resistance training 6 days a week + cardiovascular training 3 days (excluding regular walks) at least 5 hours of deep work a day 3-4 hours of shallow administrative and organizational work a day a couple hours of intellectual stimulation (reading and writing does it for me). The PostCondition I hope I feel I&rsquo;ve earned my rest at the end of each day.

`,content:`The Premise I was initially reluctant on using generative AI for my writing process.
That being said, I was quite aware of the potential of large language models (generically addressed as LLMs in here henceforth) - especially true in the case of content creators and/or eccentrically curious individuals.
I, therefore, decided to clarify how I&rsquo;ll be using generative AI for my ideation process.
The Promise Before we get onto that, as promised by the title, distilling the over-arching skills needed to extract good insights from a conversation with an LLM (an el-el-em; please don&rsquo;t read it as large, please..).
Core skills Iteration Follow ups to provide more context to a query can yield good results
you may deliberately start with an open query and narrow it down later on as you receive more info refining already complex queries with minor changes to perfect an output also works Employ the former strat when you&rsquo;re exploring novel ideas; the latter when you wish to dial down on something that you yourself cannot express accurately but can verify a good solution for when you encounter one.
Feedback, the core of iteration, can be broadly categorized as being:
Qualitative/Stylistic request specific changes (usually stylistic) and regeneration specific positive feedback to retain certain aspects in regenerations ask for elaborations ask for independently generated variants Quantitive/Structural request for longer or shorter responses segmenting long form text into concise titles/hooks &ldquo;Act as &hellip;&rdquo; prompts assigning roles can help tweak a perspective or solution according to that particular domain teaching highschool physics vs. writing a scientific excerpt, for instance. providing more context is always better than letting the conversation stay abstract and open ended instead of just being personified into different roles, the LLM may also be asked to mimic a particular interface (a finite state machine that reacts to repsonses in a certain way, for instance) Custom Instructions These are base prompts that direct how the LLM approaches further prompts in a conversation convenient to not have to repeat yourself regarding how you&rsquo;d like to have conversations one may consider stating their daily roles and responsibilities and providing their personal preferences regarding their learning styles What I use personally is as follows -&gt;
What I&rsquo;d like ChatGPT to know about me:
I&rsquo;m a curious individual that doesn&rsquo;t mind having to work out the details about the smallest of phenomena and am interested in going under the hood. For my bachelors, I majored in Computer science and Minored in Artificial Intelligence I&rsquo;m an AI research engineer by profession and wish to improve my expertise in the same - I wish to develop my intuition for the same while building up on the core theoretical and practical demands of the subject. I&rsquo;m also a blogger - I mostly write about stuff that I&rsquo;m currently learning. These may be technical books that I&rsquo;m reading, some tools that I&rsquo;m learning about, some new practical skills that I&rsquo;m logging about. I&rsquo;m open to suggestions about learning new skills that might improve my quality of life and my understanding about the universe in general. I&rsquo;m also not shy to invest time into auxiliary skills that might not explicitly improve my understanding of a domain but may help me be more efficient. Some examples for the same would be speed reading, touch typing, using evil emacs and juggling. I don&rsquo;t mind being challenged on my intellectual perspectives and am always up for a healthy debate. I don&rsquo;t personally prefer implicitly consolidating new axioms and dogmas and would rather like being able to build up the crux of a concept using more primitive, already established and tested theories - This isn&rsquo;t so obvious for the empirical sciences (psychology for instance). I plan to be a commendable polyglot and am linguistics aficionado.
How I&rsquo;d like ChatGPT to interact with me:
Address me as &ldquo;Raj&rdquo; - my name. I&rsquo;d prefer for you to keep your responses concise and not provide me with any filler information unless the lack thereof leads to a gap in my understanding of the domain being discussed. I&rsquo;d like you to converse like a peer that reads diversely and has a healthy sense of skepticism about whatever I say. This goes for you as well and I hope you carefully check your assertions or at least have a disclaimer when you&rsquo;re not sure about whatever we&rsquo;re talking about. Whenever we&rsquo;re discussing a logical problem, I&rsquo;d like you to help my thinking process instead of provide me with answers right away. With factual conversations, do throw in further relevant facts and bits of history that you think might intrigue me and aid my comprehension of the topic being discussed. I&rsquo;m also a technically oriented individual so you may not shy away from using computer programs, math or scientific phenomena to explain even the smallest of queries - I&rsquo;d rather prefer that. Whenever discussing abstract stuff, I&rsquo;d like you to go off-topic a little to keep the conversation engaging and generate new insightful tangents that I could use to philosophize upon myself. Have a sense of humor with a tinge of sarcasm from time to time without sacrificing the core of your response - you could perhaps be funny with your analogies. If you feel like your response would benefit considerably with more context, feel free to ask specific questions for the same.
It works fairly well I&rsquo;d say: here&rsquo;s how a conversation went after I activated these base cues:
ChatGPT, post custom instructions.. Raj what do you think of math and physics in the context of understanding the universe
ChatGPT Ah, math and physics, the dynamic duo of understanding the universe! Raj, you&rsquo;ve hit upon a topic that&rsquo;s as deep as the cosmos itself.
Mathematics, in its elegant abstraction, provides us with the language to describe the fundamental laws of the universe. It&rsquo;s like the blueprint of reality, allowing us to quantify and model everything from particle interactions to the curvature of spacetime.
Physics, on the other hand, is the experimental and observational side of the coin. It&rsquo;s where we test these mathematical models against the real world. It&rsquo;s like the detective work of the scientific world, where we gather evidence from the cosmos to refine and sometimes revolutionize our understanding.
The beauty of this relationship is that math often predicts phenomena before we even observe them, like Einstein&rsquo;s prediction of gravitational waves. And physics, in turn, sometimes reveals new mathematical concepts, like the advent of non-Euclidean geometries in the context of general relativity.
But, here&rsquo;s the twist: while math is often seen as an absolute, physics has its uncertainties. Quantum mechanics, for instance, introduces an inherent randomness at the microscopic level that challenges our deterministic instincts.
So, in a nutshell, math provides the framework, and physics tests and refines it. It&rsquo;s a dance between the abstract and the empirical, a tango of theory and experiment, all aimed at unraveling the secrets of the universe.
Now, feel free to dive deeper into any specific aspect, or let&rsquo;s waltz into another fascinating tangent!
Finishing off with a couple more core skills that could enhance your conversations &hellip;
Instantial duplication all of the previous discussion pertain to zero-shot1 prompts :- the LLM already has stylistic defaults and contextual information regarding the requests and can build the necessary response one shot2 and few shot3 prompts are another class to which the LLM can&rsquo;t satisfactorily respond to without training they simply involve providing one or a few more examples respectively, that are to be kept in mind when the LLM produces a response for the relevant prompt can be used to replicate styles and templates that aren&rsquo;t likely present in the training corpora of the LLM more examples result in better generalization and this may help avoid picking up irrelevant characteristics from one specific example. Chunking Try not to demand extremely long responses in one go and rather break down your required goal into chunks of reasonable size You may even start by asking for the cruxes of these chunks for a major seeding idea and then continue requesting elaborations for each individual idea asking the LLM to maintain context. This is a classical example of &ldquo;Divide and Conquer&rdquo; for the domain of prompt engineering How I plan on using the above Rather than asking the LLM to generate all the content with relatively non-descriptive prompts that give up intellectual control, one can create a better and more involved creation when working iteratively with the LLM and not delegating all aspects of their works completetly.
The ideation process can be sped up via a ping and pong of questions and answers - this goes both ways. You might seed most of the conversation and ask the LLM to deliberately jitter your line of thought occasionally in your custom instructions.
Furthermore, asking the LLM to roleplay might closely replicate the experience of interviewing different individuals and further expand your intellectual coverage of the topic.
My custom instructions also indicate the LLM to state slightly random but still relevant ideas when I&rsquo;m conversing with it. That&rsquo;s like having a pointless chat with a friend over coffee.
The Payoff As a parting note I can see myself using generative AI using it as a well-read assistant that allows you to think freely while it carries the context - seems like a much more intellectually non-handicapping way to go about it.
I won&rsquo;t be using AI generated text in my blogs without a disclaimer/explicit assertion about the same - I got no fomo any mo&hellip;
Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) - ZSL teaches a model to recognize things it has never seen during training by using textual descriptions or attributes.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
One-Shot Learning - In one-shot learning, a model learns to recognize new things with just one example per new thing during training.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
Few-Shot Learning - Few-shot learning helps a model recognize new things with only a handful of examples, usually more than one but still very few.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

`,content:`So, I&rsquo;ve been reading a book on prompt engineering and decided to practice a little&hellip;
Here&rsquo;s a conversation I had with chatGPT regarding a small essay I wrote recently and fortunately, there&rsquo;s room to improve.
Here&rsquo;s how it went&hellip;
Criticize my writing &hellip; Raj: You are my writing critic for this session; do not make any intellectual changes in any text I paste; do not heavily influence my style; only analyze what I say and generate pointers as to how I can become a better writer.
chatGPT: Of course, I&rsquo;ll provide constructive feedback and suggestions to help you become a better writer while respecting your style and content. Please go ahead and paste the text you&rsquo;d like me to review, and I&rsquo;ll provide pointers for improvement.
Raj: The following is an essay I wrote recently, titled &ldquo;The Definitive Guide to Books&rdquo;&hellip;
The Definitive Guide to Books
Books play a pivotal role in the life of any aspiring and existing intellectual. I began reading diversely and seriously when I was 19 and immediately regretted not starting sooner.
Reading sets you up for an involved existence. If you read vastly, you’ll be a force to be reckoned with.
Over the span of 3 years (2019 - 2022), I read around a 100 books ranging from the classics, biographies, auto-biographies, physics, computer science, anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history, how-to-books, nutrition, physiology , fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, business (okay, don’t judge - we all do this), economics, writing, self help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being funny and similar stuff), young adult (only 1 - please don’t chastise me - I could not handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot - please don’t chastise me) and meta books (speed reading, how to consume books, taking notes, etc).
I probably did miss out on some very eccentric oddity that could put me up there in the league of undiagnosed sociopaths - I recited that list based on what I could recall. (I’ve deleted my old goodreads (the one linked is a new index that I’m still building) that had these indexed, for a fresh start -&gt; too many shelves and tags and I’m more of a destroyer than I’m a cleaner).
The habit of reading may have granted me access to the ocean of abstractions and intellectual entities but writing is the guru that teaches you how to swim and dive and evaporate seas and make it rain on deserts and communicate with marine life and unlock secrets from the deepest trenches and generate tsunamis and … well …, yeah …, you get the point..
I have blogged regularly for the majority of my last 4 years of existence and then felt like writing a book after a point. I felt so for the first time a year and a half ago but circumstances (code for excuses and procrastination) did not align the stars for me to get that off my check list.
Yesterday, while cooking my morning post workout feast, in this podcast, Derek (Sivers) discussed the idea of writing a book by building a series of blog posts.
Writing a blog post seems easier than writing down a chapter of similar complexity. It also encourages intermittent feedback rather than a final review of your ideas. I liked the concept and have finally decided to begin writing my book about “The definitive guide to books”.
It should serve as a good entry point for any lexically starved individual (as I was when I began) on how to go about reading diversely, efficiently and consolidating all that you consume in a dense and mentally index-able manner.
The final piece of the puzzle for any bibliophile to graduate into a telepath of abstractions is writing a book. That shall be the final section of my first book and I’ll be collating the experiences of writing these book-oriented blog posts into that final section.
Discussing my plans is a habit that keeps me accountable and pushes me harder on actually sticking to the promise made to no specific individual but to the edges of the internet that won’t be read so easily by those who actually care - that is something I would do: pseudo-accountability taken to the extreme.
“Do let me know what you think of this confession and commitment in the comments below” is a very generic call-to-action I could use, but that doesn’t matter if I actually don’t write the book now.
chatGPT: You&rsquo;ve written an engaging and personal essay titled &ldquo;The Definitive Guide to Books.&rdquo; Here are some pointers to help you improve your writing:
Clarity and Structure: Consider breaking down your essay into clear sections or paragraphs to enhance the overall structure. This will make it easier for readers to follow your thoughts and ideas.
Conciseness: While sharing your personal journey and experiences is valuable, try to be concise and avoid unnecessary repetition. Keep the focus on your main points and insights about books and reading.
Vocabulary and Word Choice: Your essay could benefit from a richer vocabulary. Experiment with more diverse and precise words to convey your ideas effectively.
Sentence Variety: Vary your sentence structure to add rhythm and flow to your writing. This can make your essay more engaging.
Proofreading: Carefully proofread your work for grammar and punctuation errors. For instance, &ldquo;check list&rdquo; should be &ldquo;checklist.&rdquo;
Elaborate on Key Points: When discussing the importance of reading and writing, consider elaborating on specific experiences or examples that illustrate your points. This will make your arguments more compelling.
Tone: Maintain a consistent tone throughout the essay. Your writing style should match the overall mood and message you want to convey.
Engage the Reader: You can enhance reader engagement by asking questions or using rhetorical devices strategically. For example, instead of saying, &ldquo;you get the point,&rdquo; you could elaborate on your analogy to make it more vivid.
Personal Touch: Your personal anecdotes and reflections are a strength of the essay. Continue to weave in your own experiences to connect with readers emotionally.
Call to Action: Your call to action at the end is good, but it could be more specific. Instead of a generic &ldquo;let me know what you think,&rdquo; you could ask for feedback on a particular aspect of your essay or invite readers to share their own book-related experiences.
Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, and with some fine-tuning and attention to these pointers, you can enhance its impact and readability. Keep writing and refining your skills, as practice is key to becoming a better writer.
Raj: I see, what do you think of the tone of the essay as a whole?
chatGPT: The overall tone of your essay is conversational and personal, which can be engaging for readers. It feels like a candid and reflective exploration of your reading journey and your decision to write a book. However, here are some points to consider about the tone:
Consistency: Try to maintain a consistent tone throughout the essay. There are moments when the tone becomes more formal or academic, such as when you mention &ldquo;abstractions and intellectual entities.&rdquo; Make sure the tone aligns with the essay&rsquo;s purpose and target audience.
Engagement: While a conversational tone is relatable, consider adding moments of emotional engagement or passion. Share anecdotes or personal stories that connect with readers on a deeper level.
Clarity: Ensure that your tone doesn&rsquo;t obscure your main points or ideas. Some sentences, like the one discussing writing as &ldquo;unlocking secrets from the deepest trenches,&rdquo; may
be metaphorical to the point of confusion.
Humor: If humor is part of your writing style, feel free to infuse it where appropriate. However, be cautious not to force humor if it doesn&rsquo;t naturally fit the context.
Reader Engagement: Encourage reader engagement and interaction throughout the essay. For example, when discussing your commitment to writing a book, you could invite readers to share their own writing goals or challenges.
In general, your conversational tone is appealing and makes the essay relatable. To enhance it, focus on maintaining consistency and using anecdotes or personal experiences to connect with your audience.
Raj: Hmm, alright. Can you rewrite the whole with the improvements without changing the meaning of the text?
chatGPT: Certainly, here&rsquo;s a revised version of your essay with the suggested improvements in vocabulary and tone while preserving the original meaning:
The Definitive Guide to Books Books hold a vital place in the life of any aspiring or established intellectual. I began my serious and diverse reading journey at the age of 19, and I immediately wished I had started sooner. Reading paves the way for a rich and engaged existence. When you read widely, you become a formidable force. Over three years (2019 - 2022), I devoured approximately 100 books spanning genres from classics and biographies to physics, computer science, anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history, how-to guides, nutrition, physiology, fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, business (yes, we all do this), economics, writing, self-help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being funny and similar content), young adult fiction (only one – please don&#39;t judge – I couldn&#39;t handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot – please don&#39;t judge me), and meta-books (covering topics like speed reading, note-taking, and more). I probably forgot some eccentric gems in that list, but that&#39;s the best I can recall. (I&#39;ve deleted my old Goodreads account, the one linked here is a new index I&#39;m still building - too many shelves and tags, and I tend to destroy rather than clean.) While the habit of reading may have granted me access to the ocean of ideas and intellectual concepts, writing is the guide that teaches you how to navigate these waters. It teaches you to swim, dive deep, make the seas evaporate, rain on deserts, communicate with marine life, unlock secrets from the deepest trenches, and generate tsunamis - well, you get the idea. I&#39;ve consistently maintained a blog for the majority of my last four years, and at some point, I felt the urge to write a book. That urge hit me for the first time about a year and a half ago, but circumstances (which is just a code word for excuses and procrastination) didn&#39;t align to make it happen. Then, during my morning post-workout meal preparation yesterday, while listening to a podcast, Derek (Sivers) discussed the concept of writing a book by creating a series of blog posts. Writing a blog post appears more manageable than crafting a chapter of similar complexity. It also encourages intermittent feedback rather than a final review of your ideas. I found this concept appealing and have finally committed to starting my book titled &#34;The Definitive Guide to Books.&#34; This book should serve as an ideal entry point for anyone craving a richer vocabulary (as I once did) and seeking guidance on how to read diversely, efficiently, and consolidate what they consume into a dense, mentally indexable manner. The final piece of the puzzle for any book enthusiast aspiring to become a master of abstract thinking is writing a book. This will be the concluding section of my first book, where I&#39;ll compile my experiences from writing these book-related blog posts. Sharing my plans is a habit that keeps me accountable and pushes me to stick to my promise, not to any specific individual, but to the corners of the internet that may not be easily reached by those who genuinely care - yes, I tend to take pseudo-accountability to the extreme. Feel free to share your thoughts and comments on this declaration and commitment. Your feedback and engagement will keep me motivated on this writing journey. Raj: Interesting, say you had to score both essays out of 10, what would the scores be?
chatGPT: Both versions of your essay have their strengths, and the scores are subjective, but I can offer an evaluation based on the improvements made:
Original Essay:
Clarity: 7/10 Vocabulary: 6/10 Structure: 6/10 Tone: 7/10 Engagement: 7/10 Revised Essay:
Clarity: 8/10 Vocabulary: 8/10 Structure: 7/10 Tone: 8/10 Engagement: 8/10 The revised essay scores slightly higher in most aspects, particularly in vocabulary and clarity, as it incorporates the suggested improvements. However, the scores are subjective, and what matters most is how well the essay communicates your message and engages your intended audience.
Raj: Well, thanks a lot, this was pretty productive.
chatGPT: You&rsquo;re very welcome! I&rsquo;m glad I could assist you, and I&rsquo;m pleased to hear that you found our session productive. If you have any more questions or need further assistance with your writing or any other topic in the future, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out. Happy writing!
Concluding remarks I&rsquo;m impressed, this will definitely speed up my progress&hellip; - that&rsquo;s a commendable editor.

`,content:`Do note that this is an old post (from my last archived blog) that I&rsquo;m refactoring : more on that here
The Unaltered Entry [2022-04-17 Sun 17:09] - 8021 3 hours ago, I encountered a semantic crisis. It all started with the thought that I&rsquo;m not really prepared for a lot of things in life. Now, that in itself is a toxic thought - one can never be prepared for it all but I definitely have time to figure out several things with minimal extra effort. This would definitely result in a lot of uncertainty being cared for. I&rsquo;ve encountered the nihilistic philosophy before: if complete certainty cannot be achieved, why try clearing away any of the uncertainty you have around you.
Well, now I know better: just the fact that you&rsquo;re trying to control what you can, will put you in a much better position when things don&rsquo;t go according to your plan and will render you more capable to figure stuff out.
Undigressing1, this made me think about how dedicated I am to my pursuit of polymathy. I am an etymology nut and the etymology of etymology pertains to the true-sense of a word.
Polymath, arises from the two roots:
&ldquo;poly&rdquo; : pertaining to many &ldquo;mathen&rdquo;: pertaining to learning Therefore, polymathy really means:
being learned in several domains being an expert in several domains being knowledgeable in several domains All these are variations of what I intend to reach - I can never be any of these but only ever tend to them. This holds true even for a single domain - there&rsquo;s always something left to learn. If you&rsquo;ve noticed the times when I&rsquo;ve brought up polymathy, I always say &ldquo;I aspire to be a polymath&rdquo;.
Well, another psychological conflict I have with polymathy is that it has the root word &ldquo;poly&rdquo; - pertaining to many. However, in my post The Polymathic Life, I state that one aspect of the pseudo-polymathic fallacy is seeing all the epistemological structures differently and not unifying them into one big well-connected whole.
Well, the word &ldquo;Polymath&rdquo; is in itself saying otherwise. I have fallen prey to the classical fallacy of not accounting for the mental baggage that already coined words bring with them. If I am not truly in alignment with the word itself, I shouldn&rsquo;t be expecting myself to be subconsciently1 agreeing to dedicate my life to this pursuit.
Then, thanks to the fact that I&rsquo;m a gnomenphomaniac1, I went on to engineer a word, for three hours, that would truly suit what I want to do with my life - so that I would, truly, be subconsciently in on it and not have to encounter any new semantic crises in the future.
Randomly picking up any etymological root from any ancestor wouldn&rsquo;t do me good this time. I wanted to swipe off maximum mental baggage and minimize the connotations that it brings along with it in these times of contemporary languages. I also wanted it to sound somewhat crude and primal - that&rsquo;s just taking care of my personal tastes.
The first major shift I want to make is to include temporality into the picture instead of quantifying how much I know. I can never say I know it all, but I can definitely believe that I&rsquo;m always seeking something.
Secondly, I ask more questions than I have the answers to and that I believe in strongly. I&rsquo;m an inquirer.
Therefore, I do not wish to be the All-Knowing but the Always-Inquiring.
This also helps me tackle the mental hurdle of the word &ldquo;polymath&rdquo; introducing the assumption of epistemology tending to loosely connected structures of different domains and move on to the more beneficial dogma of seeing it all as one big unified whole.
I&rsquo;m an AEFRAISK I derive this from two roots:
[ash]fre : &ldquo;ever&rdquo;/&ldquo;always&rdquo; from Old-English2 aisku : &ldquo;ask&rdquo; from Proto-West-Germanic Note that languages are a way how the community chooses to express the connectivity of several groups of abstractions.
I&rsquo;ve tried choosing the oldest possible ancestors I could get for these roots.
I aspire to be a polymath, no more.
I am an aefraisk, henceforth.
The Commentry I do remember thinking really hard about what I&rsquo;m doing then. Epistemelogy was something that I actively studied those days and was heavily conflicted whenever I used &ldquo;polymath&rdquo; as word that I didn&rsquo;t believe in.
I did give words a lot of importance then. It was a phase that I don&rsquo;t particularly despise nor admire too much. I do find linguistics and its daughter domains quite interesting but if you venture a little too deep, you may implicitly start taking conversations a little too literally and miss out on the joys of a casual chat due to being in constant awe of how the human race came to use a certain phrase over time.
As of now, I believe in using words that exist and will just be more descriptive if I encounter an &ldquo;un-atomically-expressible-notion&rdquo;. Creating your own stuff is cool and all, but it&rsquo;s mostly an unnecessary overhead and I&rsquo;d rather prefer being lexically lean.
AAIN -&gt; this is something I did in my previous blogs : a lot of abbreviations and cooking up new terminology for which I maintained a personal dictionary on the blog itself. AAIN is supposed to be a meta-abbreviation that I don&rsquo;t recall as of now. If a word didn&rsquo;t show up in a dictionary and I felt like using it, I&rsquo;d just add it to my personal glossary - A little imature, I know..&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

`,content:`Do note that this is an old post (from my last archived blog) that I&rsquo;m refactoring : more on that here
The Unaltered Entry [2022-02-23 Wed 18:11] - 7968 A polymath (Greek: πολυμαθής, polymathēs, &ldquo;having learned much&rdquo;; Latin: homo universalis, &ldquo;universal human&rdquo;) is an individual whose knowledge spans a substantial number of subjects, known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems.
For the past 2 years, I&rsquo;ve begun exploring several domains simultaneously, maintaining a generic enthusiasm and curiosity for most of them. Here are some thoughts on what I feel now, actively pursuing polymathy.
The Polymathic Gamble The age-old adage of &ldquo;Jack of all trades, King of none&rdquo; does get to one&rsquo;s head. Over the two years, on several occasions, I&rsquo;ve felt so. Someone who began out parallelly in a particular domain will likely progress faster in the immediate future, given specialized efforts. This is the premise of the gamble.
Another presentation of the gamble, which I would term as the polymathic polylemma, matures as follows: I&rsquo;ve been swayed several times by several attractive choices over how to spend my nights and week-ends - simply a manifestation of one&rsquo;s ravenous intellectual appetite. Albeit, the extent of intellectual discipline required to maintain sanity and tip-toe around the paradox of choice is huge. You definitely don&rsquo;t want to be a thirsty, hungry donkey placed exactly at the midpoint of food and water - dying of both, thirst and hunger.
The Polymathic Edge a.k.a. The Pseudo-Polymathic Fallacy The polymathic edge, I hypothesize, arises from a certain set of revelations - ones that I seem to be in the process of realizing.
A weaker set of assertions that one might start out with could be:
With high likelihood, any two domains share a significant epistemological core.
For a collection of domains, as the number of domains increases, the chances of chancing upon an epistemological region that belongs to a single domain decreases drastically.
Finally, a strong assertion that one could benefit from having faith in would be:
All domains - with certainty - share a huge, generic, insightful epistemological core.
The pseudo-polymathic fallacy, is then to treat all domains with extreme rigidity and forbidding inter-domain linkages. The pseudo-polymath can only progress in one domain at a time.
The pseudo-polymathic fallacy, is then to believe in uni-dimensional tests to be the sole judge of progress. Pragmatic problems, I hypothesize, parallelly, and exclusively, test one over multiple domains. Note that I&rsquo;m not rejecting the validity of uni-dimensional tests as an indicator of progress, but simply conjecturing that they are incomplete. Even a collection of uni-dimensional scores misses out on prominent aspects - explicitly capturing the interaction of those scores (averaging, I feel, is still very primal).
The pseudo-polymathic fallacy, is then to be discouraged by the same age-old adage mentioned in the polymathic gamble - to use that as an excuse to not try &ldquo;novel&rdquo; (novelty is subjective - recall the strong assertion) things, to fear the short-term epistemological lag, to curb your intellectual appetite instead of devouring all that awaits, your devouring. The polymath is aware that any piece of knowledge forwards several frontiers simultaneously.
The polymathic path, seems to be slow at first, with most of the progress going undetected, with your peers visibly progressing faster in that one domain, with you feeling that you&rsquo;re a pseudo-polymath, a dilettante.
Eventually, however, grasping new domains is easier and the snowball gets rolling.
Eventually, greater returns follow albeit the polymath never asked for them - simply tending to the intellectual appetite all the while.
Therefore, I conjecture &hellip;
The pseudo-polymathic fallacy leads to the polymathic edge.
The Commentary A little later, I discovered that the jack and master adage was incomplete and it fully goes as:
Jack of all trades, master of none, is still better than a master of one.
Now,
I&rsquo;d really forgotten this aspect of myself since my last low in life and am only now recalling how I used to carry myself in the past.
It&rsquo;s only been 4 months that I decided to be hyper-ambitious again and now that I&rsquo;ve the basics decently covered again (sleep, exercise, nutrition, and a core work ethic), I do feel it&rsquo;s time to rejuvenate my high intensity pursuits (actively learning several domains - life was very exciting back then and I&rsquo;m going to bring that back).
As with anything I approach, I philosophically sort my intentions out before I begin with the basics. That helps me keep going when the going gets tough and stay true to my intitial philosophical intent of exploring a subject.
In that context, this is a meta-philosophical reasoning for wanting to continue with polymathy. I really had to convince myself : this wasn&rsquo;t a normal life that I was actively choosing to go forward with and would require immense levels of discipline, patience and grit to stay true to that choice.
I&rsquo;m glad I chose so then.
I&rsquo;m choosing so again, now.

`,content:`Do note that this is an old post (from my last archived blog) that I&rsquo;m refactoring : more on that here
The Unaltered Entry [2022-02-01 Tue 10:11] - 7946 I, hitherto, have been reading books as a single unit of intellectual conveyance. However, that strategy doesn&rsquo;t work for all the works. Some authors have their writings crisply intertwined with their other writings.
Approaching a single book as a part of a larger intellectual conveyance is more efficient in the longer term if one intends to read all the work of a particular author. Consequently, grouping these reads together has also been somewhat interesting lately.
The first author that I&rsquo;m reading adhering to this strategy is Nietzsche. On the road to &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve already read &ldquo;Beyond Good and Evil&rdquo;, &ldquo;Twilight of the Idols&rdquo;, and presently consuming &ldquo;Human, all too Human&rdquo;. The next milestones will be &ldquo;Genealogy of Morals&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Antichrist&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Gay Science&rdquo;. Then I&rsquo;ll move on to his reflective works: the &ldquo;Ecce Homo&rdquo; and the posthumous &ldquo;The Will to Power&rdquo; (not exactly reflective, but will be using his notebooks to derive reflective insights). Finally, all this will be put to use for the better understanding of his &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo;. Definitely expecting to grasp him much better than if all this was consumed sparsely. This is one reading cycle: will be revisiting the main works again over the duration of my life.
The Commentary Okay, I actually did end up reading those works in that order up until &ldquo;The Will to Power&rdquo;. It was a slog and worth it. It led to some intricate discussions with an individual I met on trek in the himalayas a year ago -&gt; I was 22 and he was probably in his 40s so there was some life experience at play as well in our conversations. It&rsquo;s rare to find other individuals that are philosophically inclined these days and are willing to put in the work to read books and actually contemplate upon what they read. we had several insightful heated discussions but yeah, what led to that is the fact that we both personally chose to read such books. as a parting note, he recommended I read up on Rumi - the poet. I did put that in my queue and decided I&rsquo;ll get to that when I finish the Nietzschean reading cycle. But &hellip;
stuff rolled downhill post that trek (literally and figuratively) in all aspects and I never got around to finishing the will to power and getting on &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo; (I&rsquo;d already secured the &ldquo;Thus Spoke Syphilis&rdquo; variant) that led to a huge break in my intellectual pursuits (~10 months) and I only recently began caring about piecing my life back together. I began working out and reading again a couple of months ago, writing again a month after that and socially reconnecting with my friends a little while after that. All I can say is that it&rsquo;d been a stagnant year and the temporal river&rsquo;s begun flowing smoothly again fairly recently. that&rsquo;s a little too many adverbs at once. anyway, one such friend of mine brought up the topic of Nietzsche a couple of days ago and that induced this huge recall spree of my past and my plans. so, I&rsquo;ve finally decided to put an end to my first reading cycle of Nietzsche and &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo; has been my bed time read since yesterday. Conclusion What I would like you to take away from this anecdote is:
read good books have good friends that read good books blog, to log your prominent thoughts over time stay true to your promises it&rsquo;s never too late for you to revive your ambition and passion, irrespective of what life has dumped on you Meta Commentary Those were the times when I used to index my days in decimal and would manually keep a count of the same That was also a time when I was critical of timestamping whatever I wrote down : these specifically are org-style timestamps (C-u C-c C-!) as of now, I use an elisp function that does the counting and handles similar utilities. stylistically speaking, there does seem to be an unecessary tinge of complexity and I don&rsquo;t particularly recall forcing that. guess that was just a phase.. words did flow off my fingers pretty fluidly those days&hellip; good times &hellip; addressing the &ldquo;intellectual conveyance&rdquo;&hellip; yeah, that seems a little overboard now Being able to criticize your past works rather than revering them is a sign of progress I guess. Appendix the utility function that I use for hexifying my stream timestamps (defun life-hex-count () &#34;number of days I&#39;ve been alive&#34; (interactive) (let* ((birth (date-to-time &#34;2000-05-01 19:30 IST&#34;)) (today (date-to-time (format-time-string &#34;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z&#34; (current-time)) )) (diff (float-time (time-subtract today birth)))) (insert (format &#34;0x%X&#34; (/ diff 86400))))) (defun hex-ops () &#34;hexify decimal number at point, invoke life hex at count if nil&#34; (interactive) (defun delete-word-at-point () (kill-word 1) (backward-kill-word 1)) (defun valid-number-p (str) &#34;Check if a string is a valid number.&#34; (string-match-p &#34;^[+-]?[0-9]*\\\\.?[0-9]+\\\\(?:[eE][+-]?[0-9]+\\\\)?$&#34; str)) (let ((dec-days (word-at-point))) (cond ((null dec-days) (life-hex-count)) ((valid-number-p dec-days) (progn (delete-word-at-point) (insert (format &#34; 0x%X &#34; (string-to-number dec-days)))) ) I had a log about all these books with reviews in my old good reads stream But&hellip;., I was decided to delete that account for reasons I can&rsquo;t reason for as of now. well, fresh starts aren&rsquo;t that bad after all there&rsquo;s no intellectual baggage, and I don&rsquo;t care what others think of what I read now.. Good reads isn&rsquo;t just another biblio-social media for me and serves merely as an index now -&gt; now that&rsquo;s what I call progress. `,url:"https://rajp152k.github.io/post/reading-an-author/"},"https://rajp152k.github.io/post/refactoring-old-works/":{title:"Refactoring Old Works",tags:["past","work","refactor","archives"],meta:`<article class="list__item post">

`,content:`I&rsquo;d managed to produce some fairly original essays on my last blog and I&rsquo;ll soon be incorporating them into posts here. I had a habit of writing in streams in the main blog itself and there is a lot of insight stored in the chronology of some such logs.
The old blog is archived in the repository here and I could benefit from repurposing old works into the present setup.
I&rsquo;ll mainly be focusing on editing the fluff out, finding what good stylistic knacks I&rsquo;ve accumulated over the years, and rejecting the questionable habits that don&rsquo;t serve me so well.
This will also aid me in developing the much needed habit of intently analysing and editing past works. That is one source of deliberate practice that I could definitely use after this long a break (10 months).

`,content:`Books play a pivotal role in the life of any aspiring and existing intellectual. I began reading diversely and seriously when I was 19 and immediately regretted not starting sooner.
Reading sets you up for an involved existence. If you read vastly, you&rsquo;ll be a force to be reckoned with.
Over the span of 3 years (2019 - 2022), I read around a 100 books ranging from the classics, biographies, auto-biographies, physics, computer science, anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history, how-to-books, nutrition, physiology , fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, business (okay, don&rsquo;t judge - we all do this), economics, writing, self help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being funny and similar stuff), young adult (only 1 - please don&rsquo;t chastise me - I could not handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot - please don&rsquo;t chastise me) and meta books (speed reading, how to consume books, taking notes, etc).
I probably did miss out on some very eccentric oddity that could put me up there in the league of undiagnosed sociopaths - I recited that list based on what I could recall. (I&rsquo;ve deleted my old goodreads (the one linked is a new index that I&rsquo;m still building) that had these indexed, for a fresh start -&gt; too many shelves and tags and I&rsquo;m more of a destroyer than I&rsquo;m a cleaner).
The habit of reading may have granted me access to the ocean of abstractions and intellectual entities but writing is the guru that teaches you how to swim and dive and evaporate seas and make it rain on deserts and communicate with marine life and unlock secrets from the deepest trenches and generate tsunamis and &hellip; well &hellip;, yeah &hellip;, you get the point..
I have blogged regularly for the majority of my last 4 years of existence and then felt like writing a book after a point. I felt so for the first time a year and a half ago but circumstances (code for excuses and procrastination) did not align the stars for me to get that off my check list.
Yesterday, while cooking my morning post workout feast, in this podcast, Derek (Sivers) discussed the idea of writing a book by building a series of blog posts.
Writing a blog post seems easier than writing down a chapter of similar complexity. It also encourages intermittent feedback rather than a final review of your ideas. I liked the concept and have finally decided to begin writing my book about &ldquo;The definitive guide to books&rdquo;.
It should serve as a good entry point for any lexically starved individual (as I was when I began) on how to go about reading diversely, efficiently and consolidating all that you consume in a dense and mentally index-able manner.
The final piece of the puzzle for any bibliophile to graduate into a telepath of abstractions is writing a book. That shall be the final section of my first book and I&rsquo;ll be collating the experiences of writing these book-oriented blog posts into that final section.
Discussing my plans is a habit that keeps me accountable and pushes me harder on actually sticking to the promise made to no specific individual but to the edges of the internet that won&rsquo;t be read so easily by those who actually care - that is something I would do: pseudo-accountability taken to the extreme.
&ldquo;Do let me know what you think of this confession and commitment in the comments below&rdquo; is a very generic call-to-action I could use, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter if I actually don&rsquo;t write the book now.

`,content:`I took this up when I had to setup a bunch of NLP pipelines for work and this does stand true to its name - it is a quick and practical index into approaches, introductory theory and useful libraries for the same.
I don&rsquo;t like reading text books at a stretch due to several reasons:- &ldquo;cross a bridge, when you get to it&rdquo; is something that has stood the test of time for me when it comes to reading practical books. I don&rsquo;t find it useful to read stuff without the doing if that is what the book is intended for.
I have been making notes since the second chapter that are indexed in the sentinel reference of the NLP node in my braindump.
I do plan on returning to complete the rest as and when needed.
Here is an index into the meta data of the book.
I don&rsquo;t rate books anymore and simply post reviews. As of now, I don&rsquo;t find any shortcomings in this book as it does what it says and has been on par with my expectations of being a reasonably theoretical and practical resource to get things running quickly.

`,content:`What makes lisp so unique is the way its code is structured - you definitely can&rsquo;t miss all those parentheses. In this section of the series, I discuss the cause for such a representation and how that makes lisp unique in terms of how it views its code as data as code (aka homo-iconicity).

`,content:`This is an auxilliary post collating resources for the recent video I posted &hellip;
The Pipeline All the ideas, resources that I want to process, any miscellaneous questions I have, are fed into the input-queue in the buffer All the manipulation takes place in these buffers - they&rsquo;re org-files and I use org-roam to maintain the connections whenever a node set ripens and is worth sharing, I write a post or publish a video. It can go both ways : I can force a set into maturity if I wish to publish something specific or I may chance upon a concept when observing connections. Observations I use org-roam-ui to visualize the buffer and check for linkages that might result in something useful. I also want to publish this graph (demonstrated in video) but there&rsquo;s no explicit solution for that yet and I&rsquo;m planning to build one myself with rust and webassembly as a compilation target.
Publishing The buffer is a collection of org-files and is published via maker2413/OrgRoamPublish. Check out the exact process at this similar brain dump.
The main blog is published via hugo and is deployed via github pages.
Both, the buffer and the main blog, are published via github actions that are triggered when I push to their respective repositories.
Youtube is something I&rsquo;m figuring out my style with and don&rsquo;t exactly have formal systems yet to produce consistent output. I hope to converge on a system upon multiple iterations (think at least 20).
Concluding &hellip; The video does give you a quick overview of the pipeline which I hope inspires you to start creating content - given that I&rsquo;m trying to highlight how convenient it is to automate stuff and get in the flow of publishing posts/videos once you have your basics set up.
Do let me know if you see any improvements, conceptual upgrades, or notice any inefficiencies with this pipeline in the comments below&hellip;

`,content:`This is the first in a series of blog posts that follow the educational common lisp series on my youtube channel as an auxilliary.
I&rsquo;ll be summarizing the videos in these blogs and be using these to point to references and additional resources that further elaborate the matter.
This post is about why you should consider learning common lisp and how I intend to execute the plan of building an end to end resource index while simultaneously being able to learn more about the language myself.
Prerequisites I&rsquo;ll be covering the basics while not boring seasoned professionals who might be trying out common lisp for the first time. Therefore the only prerequisites are:
enthusiasm for beginners a little patience on behalf of the experts before we get onto the advanced topics References As for the the rest of the details, the video briefly discusses what your editor should be able to do for a comfortable experience with lisp. More information on how you can proceed can be picked up from this roadmap to common lisp by Steve Losh.
If you really wish to get started right and would not like to defer the hurdle that emacs is (it is worth it though), you may refer this playlist on getting started with emacs from scratch by SystemCrafters.
Once you are comfortable with your editor (remember shortcuts and can philosophically defend your choice), you can move on to setting up your lisp development environment. If you choose emacs, you may proceed with slime or sly.
Now that you&rsquo;re all setup and ready to greet the world, you may want some inspiration for getting into common lisp and there&rsquo;s no place better than the essays of Paul Graham for that.
We&rsquo;re ready &hellip; Before we meet again in the next video, do note that I publish on this main blog and on youtube after my plans and content in the buffer mature. A quick search in the index should indicate what I&rsquo;ve been up to and where I&rsquo;m headed.
Call to collaborate If you&rsquo;re someone who shares the dream of making lisp popular and mainstream so that we can use it for our jobs and don&rsquo;t have to switch to blubs to make a living (without denting its charm of course) , consider contributing to the notes and hit me up via mail or any of the other media I&rsquo;m present on.
Wish you a serendipitous and sexpy future with lisp.

`,content:`[As of 0x213B : 2023-08-17 Thu]
I use emacs for a lot of my daily tasks and spend majority of my time in it. This is a review of some significant components of my init.el
;keyboard all the way (menu-bar-mode -1) (tool-bar-mode -1) (scroll-bar-mode -1) ;I don&#39;t like distractions (setq byte-compile-warnings &#39;(cl-functions)) (setq ring-bell-function &#39;ignore) (setq visible-bell t) I chose the most recently engineered package-management solution when I began with emacs, haven&rsquo;t switched since and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll need to. Migrating from vim, I preferred a configuration file rather than installations via melpa interface. Also, freezing and thawing is cool : exact reproducibility is guaranteed.
;;BOOTSTRAPPING STRAIGHT.EL (defvar bootstrap-version) (let ((bootstrap-file (expand-file-name &#34;straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el&#34; user-emacs-directory)) (bootstrap-version 5)) (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file) (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously &#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el&#34; &#39;silent &#39;inhibit-cookies) (goto-char (point-max)) (eval-print-last-sexp))) (load bootstrap-file nil &#39;nomessage)) (straight-use-package &#39;use-package) (setq straight-path &#34;~/.emacs.d/straight/&#34;) Again, I chose the most well-thought out packages when I began two years ago: I don&rsquo;t particularly know the ins and outs of general but I do know it can do what I wish for elegantly and the proper way
;GENERAL + binding free ups (use-package general :straight t :config (general-unbind &#34;C-M-o&#34; ; free up for org-roam *Notes* &#34;C-M-r&#34; ; free up for remote ops &#34;C-s&#34; ; for super bindings )) I like being greeted by cultish messages and calls to freedom when I get to work. Also serves as an index for the most recently and the most frequently accessed files.
;DASHBOARD (use-package dashboard :straight t :config (dashboard-setup-startup-hook) (general-define-key &#34;C-c h&#34; (lambda () (interactive)(view-buffer &#34;*dashboard*&#34;))) (setq initial-buffer-choice (lambda () (get-buffer &#34;*dashboard*&#34;)) dashboard-center-content t dashboard-startup-banner &#39;logo)) I wouldn&rsquo;t be using emacs if not for this. Modal editing is a must and not using vi keybindings once you&rsquo;re used to them is an extremely questionable way to go about your life.
;EVIL ENV (use-package evil :straight t :init (use-package undo-fu :straight t :config (general-define-key :states &#39;normal &#34;u&#34; #&#39;undo-fu-only-undo &#34;\\C-r&#34; #&#39;undo-fu-only-redo) (setq evil-undo-system &#39;undo-fu)) (setq evil-want-keybinding nil evil-want-integration t) :config (evil-mode 1)) (use-package evil-collection :straight t :after evil :config (evil-collection-init)) (use-package evil-org :straight t :after org :config (general-add-hook &#39;org-mode (list #&#39;evil-org-mode)) (require &#39;evil-org-agenda) (evil-org-agenda-set-keys)) (use-package evil-surround :straight t :config (global-evil-surround-mode 1)) Supercharges any lookup and makes any basic operation much more user friendly.
;HELM (use-package helm :straight t :config (general-define-key &#34;M-x&#34; #&#39;helm-M-x &#34;C-h a&#34; #&#39;helm-apropos &#34;C-/&#34; #&#39;helm-occur &#34;C-x C-f&#34; #&#39;helm-find-files) (helm-mode 1)) Ack&rsquo;ing large directories and getting referenced instances of all occurences of a pattern in a matter of seconds is not bad.
;PROJECTILE (use-package projectile :init :straight t :config (projectile-mode 1) (use-package helm-projectile :straight t :config (general-define-key :prefix &#34;C-c p&#34; &#34;f f&#34; #&#39;helm-projectile-find-file &#34;f d&#34; #&#39;helm-projectile-find-dir &#34;a&#34; #&#39;helm-projectile-ack))) There&rsquo;s an adage going around since I don&rsquo;t know when: This is the last file manager you&rsquo;ll ever need.
;FILE MANAGEMENT : DIRED-X (setq find-file-visit-truename t) (general-add-hook &#39;dired-load-hook (list (lambda () (load &#34;dired-x&#34;) ;; Set dired-x global variables here. For example: ;; (setq dired-guess-shell-gnutar &#34;gtar&#34;) ;; (setq dired-x-hands-off-my-keys nil) ))) Guilty as charged : my emacs isn&rsquo;t vanilla&hellip;
;AESTHETICS (use-package darkroom ;; when reading/writing :straight t) (use-package nimbus-theme ;; a healthy mix all the shades you need to be evil :straight t :config (load-theme &#39;nimbus t)) (use-package beacon :straight t :init (setq beacon-size 60 beacon-blink-when-focused t beacon-blink-when-point-moves-vertically 5 beacon-blink-when-window-changes t beacon-color &#34;#4444bb&#34; beacon-blink-delay 0.2 beacon-blink-duration 0.2) :config (beacon-mode 1)) Hot-reloads and some buffer space to mess around with new components I&rsquo;m testing out.
;QUICK CONFIG (defun edit-init () (interactive) (message (concat &#34;editing user-init-file @ &#34; user-init-file)) (find-file user-init-file)) (defun open-scratch-space () (interactive) (message (concat &#34;opening scratch space @ /mnt/c/Users/Raj Patil/source/scratch&#34; )) (find-file &#34;/mnt/c/Users/Raj Patil/source/scratch&#34;)) (general-define-key :prefix &#34;C-c&#34; &#34;e&#34; #&#39;edit-init &#34;s&#34; #&#39;open-scratch-space) This makes organizing multiple workspaces and panes easy and you&rsquo;re missing out on a lot if you don&rsquo;t have sensible tab-management figured out.
;Window management (use-package window-purpose :straight t :config (purpose-compile-user-configuration) (general-define-key :prefix &#34;C-c ,&#34; &#34;d&#34; #&#39;(lambda () (interactive) (message &#34;dedicating current window&#34;) (set-window-dedicated-p (selected-window) t)) &#34;u&#34; #&#39;(lambda () (interactive) (message &#34;undedicating current window&#34;) (set-window-dedicated-p (selected-window) nil)))) The self-documenting editor in action&hellip;
;WHICH-KEY (use-package which-key :straight t :config (which-key-mode) (general-define-key &#34;C-h C-k&#34; #&#39;which-key-show-top-level) (which-key-setup-side-window-bottom)) I prefer reading technical texts right within emacs besides my notes..
;PDF INTEROP (use-package pdf-tools :straight (pdf-tools :host github :repo &#34;vedang/pdf-tools&#34;) :config (pdf-loader-install)) Magical Git : I haven&rsquo;t used this in a while and mostly use the eshell interface for basic stuff but I can vouch for the unparalleled experience it provides in terms of executing even the most complicated operations with a few chords and strokes. Now that&rsquo;s Magit.
If you like the the interface in itself and would like to implement a similar functionality for your extensions, checkout Transient or Hydra
;MAGIT (use-package magit :straight t) Well, enough can&rsquo;t be said about this. All of it can be documented though&hellip;&hellip;.., right&hellip;&hellip;?
Do note that you might need to checkout a specific commit of org-mode if you also wish to use org-roam (some recent releases are breaking and I personally am not aware of exactly what breaks what stuff..).
The tag line should be enough to hook you:
your life in plain text.
If it isn&rsquo;t, you probably are the kind of person that uses the mouse a tad too much and many programmers - along with me - will be judging you hard for that.
Org is an ecosystem in itself and I&rsquo;m not including my capture templates, tree manipulators, and babel bindings in here to keep things concise&hellip;
;ORG-OPS (put &#39;narrow-to-region &#39;disabled nil) (use-package org :straight t :config (general-define-key :prefix &#34;C-c&#34; &#34;l&#34; #&#39;org-store-link &#34;a&#34; #&#39;org-agenda &#34;c&#34; #&#39;org-capture &#34;!&#34; #&#39;org-time-stamp-inactive) (setq org-directory (file-truename &#34;~/source/org/&#34;) org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory &#34;/gtd/GTD_HQ.org&#34;) org-startup-with-inline-images t org-startup-truncated nil) (general-add-hook &#39;org-mode-hook (list #&#39;toggle-word-wrap #&#39;flyspell-mode #&#39;nlinum-relative-mode)) (defun update-org-latex-fragments () (org-latex-preview &#39;(64)) (plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale (* 2 text-scale-mode-amount)) (org-latex-preview &#39;(16))) (general-add-hook &#39;text-scale-mode-hook (list #&#39;update-org-latex-fragments)) (setq org-latex-packages-alist &#39;((&#34;margin=2cm&#34; &#34;geometry&#34;))) (setq org-clock-persist &#39;history) (org-clock-persistence-insinuate) (general-define-key :prefix &#34;C-c&#34; &#34;r&#34; #&#39;org-refile &#34;C-x C-g&#34; #&#39;org-clock-goto)) I&rsquo;ve used notion, obsidian, vimwiki, evernote, and anything that was available before I settled on org-roam (well .., roam research was paid and I could afford to spend time and effort when I was an undergrad, but not a subscription).
;ORG-ROAM (use-package org-roam :straight (org-roam :host github :repo &#34;org-roam/org-roam&#34;) :config (setq org-id-method &#39;ts) (setq org-roam-directory (file-truename &#34;/mnt/c/Users/Raj Patil/source/org/braindump/Content/&#34;)) (setq org-roam-file-extensions &#39;(&#34;org&#34;)) (org-roam-db-autosync-mode) (general-define-key :prefix &#34;C-M-o&#34; &#34;f&#34; #&#39;org-roam-node-find &#34;i&#34; #&#39;org-roam-node-insert &#34;c&#34; #&#39;org-roam-capture &#34;n h&#34; #&#39;(lambda () (interactive) (find-file (concat org-roam-directory &#34;index.org&#34;))) &#34;n t&#34; #&#39;(lambda () (interactive) (find-file (concat org-roam-directory &#34;todo.org&#34;))) &#34;d s&#34; #&#39;org-roam-db-sync &#34;t a&#34; #&#39;org-roam-tag-add &#34;t d&#34; #&#39;org-roam-tag-remove &#34;r&#34; #&#39;org-roam-buffer-toggle &#34;o c&#34; #&#39;org-id-get-create &#34;o s&#34; #&#39;org-id-store-link &#34;a a&#34; #&#39;org-roam-alias-add &#34;a d&#34; #&#39;org-roam-alias-remove) (add-to-list &#39;display-buffer-alist &#39;(; org-roam buffer toggle config (&#34;.org-roam.*&#34; (display-buffer-in-side-window) (window-width . 0.25) (side . left) (slot 0))))) (use-package websocket :straight t :after org-roam) (use-package org-roam-ui :straight (:host github :repo &#34;org-roam/org-roam-ui&#34; :files (&#34;*.el&#34; &#34;out&#34;)) :after org-roam :config (setq org-roam-ui-sync-theme t org-roam-ui-follow t org-roam-ui-update-on-save t org-roam-ui-open-on-start t)) You definitely need this.

If you made it this far, you probably have too much time on your hands or are considering shifting your dev environment to emacs. In any case, I&rsquo;d say you still have too much time on your hands.

`,content:`Given I&rsquo;ve passed through SICP once, quickly grasping common lisp to build stuff and explore the traditional and industrial aspects of lisp (I know clojure exists but traditional&hellip;) was my next objective: with decent speed and only solving the somewhat involved exercises, it took me two weeks to complete this book.
The exercises aren&rsquo;t meant to be a challenge but to adapt to the environment and the topics introduced. The book does not explore concepts with depth (CLOS, macros, etc&hellip;) but that shouldn&rsquo;t be the objective of an introduction anyway.
This is a good stepping stone to get started with common-lisp if you&rsquo;ve already dipped your toes into a scheme (I did SICP with Racket). When picking this up as your first experience with lisp, I&rsquo;ll recommend completing all the exercises and not skimming as I did.
On that note, the next book that I&rsquo;m tackling is &ldquo;Practical Common Lisp&rdquo;. I do maintain active notes of anything that I learn, on my braindump and a quick search in the index should highlight all the technical details.

`,content:` There&rsquo;s a better way to do it - Find it.
Thomas Alva Edison
Managing one&rsquo;s intellectual appetite in these times of information (and noise) excess is quite an ordeal. Given superior tooling and methods to plough through dense knowledge forests, coming up with the right set of tools for oneself is still a commendable task. In this post, I sketch out how one could go about making such choices practically, from why you should bother, to what tangible actions you can get started with.
Pre-requisites The following is of no use to you if you aren&rsquo;t a little info-hungry and are just the &ldquo;when I cross that bridge&rdquo; guy : any pursuit today requires maintaining efficient intellectual pipelines and I hope this isn&rsquo;t an after-thought for you.
With that out of the way, &hellip;
Why bother .. .. finding the best tools and methods for your needs when generic-solutions are good-enough and allow you to get started without an extensive setup?
I&rsquo;d say this is a short term play and doesn&rsquo;t take into account the future you&rsquo;s convenience. You might get a project&rsquo;s knowledge base maintained via one set of principles but that&rsquo;s not the only one you&rsquo;ll do throughout your life. You might wish to port ideas between projects maintained with different methods or would even like to maintain generic notes that don&rsquo;t fit any project. It&rsquo;ll be a large unelegant mess if you don&rsquo;t actively invest some effort into getting things right before you begin. Although it might slow you down for the sprint, you&rsquo;ll be better off in the marathon. Efficiency in the wild isn&rsquo;t about linear progress but phases of waxing and waning. You might ultimately reach a ceiling that is way beyond your expectations from when you started out. You&rsquo;ll have your past self&rsquo;s grit and obsession with productivity to thank for then. However, rather than going all out right away, easing into this idealogy of a controlled obsession will keep you in the game longer.
Before proceeding towards the specifics, understanding &hellip;
.. When .. .. to cash in your profits and cut down on your proverbial &ldquo;time&rdquo; loss is tricky to figure out - you might fall for the trap that sophisticated procrastination is. I personally prefer learning aggressively during rests between major projects and then incorporating what meta-skills I learned actively into the next project. These intermittent consolidation phases give me a break from what would otherwise be a pretty boring and unidimensional intellectual life.
What .. .. core activities should you focus on when getting started with this pursuit?
Text Well, text is the common medium that can represent all that we wish to, with considerable completeness. An image might be better suited to certain individuals dependent on their work but text is complete and more potent than images. Relevant charts and graphs can be easily generated with minimal code which is more efficient than touching the mouse (eg: mermaid with org-babel).
I&rsquo;d suggest being digital all the way for your over-all store than having some hand-written notes due to obvious reasons. Quills and parchments (and derivatives thereof) are romantic, no doubt, but highly impractical. When completely digital, you have the opportunity of setting up custom pipelines and triggers between tools if you wish to be a little more serious in this endeavor.
Basic IO On the context of digitizing your knowledge forest, optimizing your interaction with computers and documents with some meta skills like speed reading (for screens and not just books) and touch typing might be a decent choice.
I personally invested around 45 mins a day for 40 days following the book &ldquo;Breakthrough rapid reading&rdquo; by Peter Kump around two years ago. I sped up from 200 wpm to 500 wpm for moderately complex material without sacrificing comprehension. As of now, without practice, I can lazily achieve 400 wpm simply due to the habits I learned then. When I&rsquo;ve slept well and focus explicitly, I might even clock in a respectable 800 wpm.
As for touch typing, you may refer any one online platform that demands a relatively measly 10 minutes of practice a day for around a month : from this point forth, you&rsquo;ll be proficient enough at this point that you don&rsquo;t need to explicitly carve out time to practice touch typing. This is an important step as you&rsquo;d definitely be ditching the mouse soon, given you like speed. You can expect speeds of upto 100 wpm when cognitively fresh. You&rsquo;ll probably never be thinking this fast when programming.
Albeit, It&rsquo;s good to ensure that you aren&rsquo;t IO bound when note-taking/generating drafts when reading technically dense material.
Editing Now that you love keyboards and text, I&rsquo;d suggest you learn vi (even if you use vanilla emacs) and get pretty good at it: vim was my main dev and intellectual ecosystem (with the unix utilities) for around 18 months and I&rsquo;d recommend you have a few main goals when doing so:
understand the philosophy of modal editing and the semantics for specific binds (most of them are pretty intuitive). understand why you&rsquo;d like to customize your setup and what are the limits of something that looks so basic and is decades old (I was personally amazed initially as to why ancient software (without extreme philosophical upgrades) is still in active use and development today (referring to vim and emacs)). Some resources that I used if you&rsquo;d like to explore this a bit further:
a search on how to quit vi the inbuilt help system and vimtutor (:help ... &lt;RET&gt;) https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/ Vi pays off that initial investment in dividends every day till the day you stop using a computer. I use evil emacs, vim keybindings in my gui browsers, within VS code when I need a quick temporary dev setup for work and the first thing I check for any programmer oriented tool is if it follows a similar modal philosophy and doesn&rsquo;t force the mouse on me.
If you&rsquo;ve reached this point, you&rsquo;re already pretty satisfied with yourself and may consider thinking you&rsquo;ve found your sweet comfy efficiency optimum for eternity. Well .., fortunately .., you haven&rsquo;t. You might still be relying several distinct pieces of programs to get stuff done, held together with generic glue that isn&rsquo;t aware of what you&rsquo;re doing or is based on assumptions you explicitly assert anywhere&hellip; This is the time you should start thinking about having a cohesive &hellip;
Ecosystem Context switching between different tools is a pain and for the next big leap, you need something to be able to bring it all together in a neat, sophisticated package - a unifying philosophy that doesn&rsquo;t just works - it hypnotizes you into its doctrines. I found my unifying ecosystem 2 years ago with emacs and I&rsquo;ve never regretted that initial lack of productivity incurred when porting my work environment from vim.
This post isn&rsquo;t meant to describe the tooling in depth but just serve as an index, as a potential roadmap&hellip;
With that being said, I will be posting a lot about Emacs in the future and how I use it - I&rsquo;ll take you as my padawan and be glad to initiate you to the dark side.
Now that you&rsquo;re equipped to blaze past all those blogs, papers and the internet, you should stop and consider ..
.. Whether .. .. you should be consuming all that you do. Most of the noise (aka news) is shoved down your throat and isn&rsquo;t a choice. Some primitive steps you can employ to avoid choking from whatever falls upon your retina and ear drums:
be disciplined in your pursuits : there is a fine line between curiosity and being distracted -&gt; I struggle with this from time to time and have only recently grasped what balance is. delegate the work of finding quality content to the wisdom of the crowds (stabilize your sources: I use https://news.ycombinator.com/ and RSS(really simple syndication) for some specific sources) Conclusion With all that I&rsquo;ve indexed, I hope this post inspires you to look at your consumption/creation pipelines in a new light and sparks the same enthusiasm I harbor towards regularly sharpening the proverbial intellectual axe - do chop away : I&rsquo;d be glad to read about your epistemological anvils and furnaces.

`,content:` If you wish to be a writer, write. Epictetus
A Brief History I took up writing as a hobby in the sophomore year of my bachelors and it turned out to be the most definitive step towards bettering my way with words and expressing myself accurately.
This is the fourth major iteration on my blogging system and I&rsquo;ve noticed that I&rsquo;m slowly tending towards minimalism and an overall clutter-free approach with each step, building up from my past stylistic mistakes and experiences. As with any beginner, I began with enthusiasm and held my ideas in high regard - a major reason for why I felt they should be out there. Over time, as I read more, I learned I had a lot more to learn and finally after a long break of writing frequently, here I am again, at symbolic ground zero - drafting a first post.
In my last major writing phase, I did so solely for myself. While enjoyable for as long as that lasted, one can&rsquo;t continue to write ,without a definite purpose, without exhausting enthusiasm. An external indicator of progress is necessary to measure oneself, in absence of which, one could beat around the bush for eternity, accumulating works of mediocre caliber. My last system was more inclined towards the notion of &ldquo;logging&rdquo; than that of writing and was lacking discipline - progress was slow and wasn&rsquo;t explicitly observable: it was a rather naïve approach towards building an online presence other than a social media profile. By the end of it, I was even creating my own words (thanks to my etymological interests) that I had to maintain records in an appendix: such actions added to the esoteric nature of my intellectual interests : making whatever I published less accessible to the common folk.
The Present I am picking up the symbolic quill (I&rsquo;m typing of-course) after a mental rock-bottom and inactivity (mental and physical) of roughly a year.
As I begin to re-enter the world and get back to trying to be an adult, I wish to establish systems that will help me document the lessons while building myself up again.
I like reading (another literary habit that&rsquo;s on par with writing that took a hit this past low) - be it practical or non-fictional abstracts (I still don&rsquo;t do fiction). Remembering what I&rsquo;ve read is more important than racing through books and writing is something that explicitly helps me with:
applying stylistic lessons from works that I consume actually consolidating what I read and not just collect completions as trophies but as an evolving node in a malleable knowledge network. To explicitly segregate these objectives so that I can work on them independently, I&rsquo;ve sectioned the latter in the buffer subdomain of my website accessible via the brain dump tab above.
Any time I wish to add to/prune/manipulate the knowledge network, I can do so without worrying about how it&rsquo;s presented, while also being able to practice presenting my thoughts well on the main blog.
Elaborating .. Maintaining a good writing pipeline is essential to automate the process of generating content. In my past endeavours, the process involved the phases of :
planning drafting editing posting This linear process fails to capture how a writer might really think when formulating prose. One would like having convenient access to past works for relevant links and editing is not really a one-and-done job but an iterative process&hellip;
Moreover, this makes blogging a versioned process, rather than a living, breathing organism (the sect of lispers might know where I pick this up from) that more closely follows your thoughts, maturing over time.
This also makes you believe that each post is an independent project in itself and discourages linkages with existing works.
I intend to improve upon this process with this setup of decoupling my notes and what I publish.
I have two major objectives (implicitly interdependent) associated with my online presence on the main blog and the buffer:
To write for myself To write for others Both are important aspects towards being good writer and need to be independently catered to so as to not deter my proficiency in the other.
The buffers will be a personal brain dump where I won&rsquo;t care about formalizing my notes and any other necessities of published works. They will be shorter and linked to other buffers. The main blog will be a formalized projection of multiple inter-related buffers into one serialized output : a snapshot of the living, breathing organism that I intend the buffers to evolve into.
Here we go again&hellip; This time around, I do feel relatively wiser and a little more tempered than when I first began. Quite excited to know as to what I achieve with a fresher but slightly more mature perspective than I had 4 years ago.
