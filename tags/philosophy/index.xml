- an unrooted snapdragon ARM Android with Termux and Tmux for ephemeral vimmin &amp;amp; sshing around when on the move&lt;br>
- an Intel x86 FreeBSD home lab for some asynchronous compute that I don&amp;rsquo;t need right away and some redundancy for my important files&lt;br>
- a personal ubuntu VPS with a couple of intel x86 vCPUs for my self hosting endeavours and overall context orchestration&lt;br>
- several compute clusters (avx enabled x86s, ARM, &amp;ldquo;the propietary GPU driver guy on the street&amp;rdquo; GPUs, &amp;ldquo;the other open source GPU driver guy on the steet&amp;rdquo; GPUs, k8s orchestrated production &amp;amp; development playgrounds) for work&lt;br>
- an AMD x86 Tumbleweed with emacs as the daily driver where I actually &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; : this is desk where I dissect, analyse, reconstruct and dispatch for usage across the above&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Most Important Book You'll Ever Read</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/most-important-book/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 04:05:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/most-important-book/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>All of us create content, every moment, tuned to varying extents of influence and
permanence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s intent that separates us all into different leagues of
producers.&lt;br>
Let me explain via a hierarchical build up of selected formats of content with
varying intensity.&lt;br>
Note that the list isn&amp;rsquo;t exhaustive by any means and I&amp;rsquo;ve deliberately
excluded works of larger scale (movies, video games : they have the
potential to be the most influential kind of content out there).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reading an Author</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/reading-an-author/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 16:46:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/reading-an-author/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do note that this is an old post (from my last archived blog) that I&amp;rsquo;m

&lt;p>I, hitherto, have been reading books as a single unit of intellectual
conveyance. However, that strategy doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for all the
works. Some authors have their writings crisply intertwined with
their other writings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Approaching a single book as a part of a larger intellectual
conveyance is more efficient in the longer term if one intends to read
all the work of a particular author. Consequently, grouping these
reads together has also been somewhat interesting lately.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
