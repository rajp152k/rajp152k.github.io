&lt;p>You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a generalist at all times during your journey into polymathy. I mentally grasped this fairly recently that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to shun specializing for smaller durations.
Something like a day is obvious as a candidate but, in the past, I would shy away from even periods of a month to actually focus on a singular thing. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly comfortable doing that for upto three months now but would recommend touching a large span of domains over the span of six months for you don&amp;rsquo;t want to start losing out on the humility that interdisciplinary pursuits enforce on you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IKN0X224C: Epistemological Polyglotism</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/linguistics-and-flow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 20:29:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/linguistics-and-flow/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>check out what an IKN0x means &lt;a href="https://thebitmage.com/post/ikn0x0/">here&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding different languages can open up one&amp;rsquo;s mind towards
different cultures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The evolution of languages over centuries and common ancestors
there-of over millenia indicates the evolution of cultural
complexity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I grew up actively conversing in 4 languages: English, Hindi,
Marathi and Gujrati. French was my first romance language I was
exposed to for over 8 years (I say exposed as was learning this
academically as a third language and didn&amp;rsquo;t use this as a &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;
language as much as the others).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hunt, Feast, Repeat</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/hunt-feast-repeat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 09:05:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/hunt-feast-repeat/</guid><description>&lt;p>I partition my days in phases of different mindsets that allow me to
cater to my varying epistemological hungers. One of them is a daily
ninety minute ideation hunt and feast that helps keep my skills sharp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The laws of thermodynamics do form a formidable devil that really does
mess up your ordered habits if you do not inject in the necessary
energy from time to time.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a way to sharpen the intellectual axe, I envision
myself going on domain hunts to allot myself a new class of game to
look forward to during minor breaks from my usual, comparatively
conventional endeavors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Do you really wanna be a Polymath?</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/aefraisk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 17:01:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/aefraisk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do note that this is an old post (from my last archived blog) that I&amp;rsquo;m

&lt;p>3 hours ago, I encountered a semantic crisis. It all started with the
thought that I&amp;rsquo;m not really prepared for a lot of things in life. Now,
that in itself is a toxic thought - one can never be prepared for it
all but I definitely have time to figure out several things with
minimal extra effort. This would definitely result in a lot of
uncertainty being cared for. I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered the nihilistic
philosophy before: if complete certainty cannot be achieved, why try
clearing away any of the uncertainty you have around you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Polymathic Gamble</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/polymathy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 16:57:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/polymathy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do note that this is an old post (from my last archived blog) that I&amp;rsquo;m

&lt;p>A polymath (Greek: πολυμαθής, polymathēs, &amp;ldquo;having learned much&amp;rdquo;; Latin: homo universalis, &amp;ldquo;universal human&amp;rdquo;) is an individual whose knowledge spans a substantial number of subjects, known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For the past 2 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun exploring several domains
simultaneously, maintaining a generic enthusiasm and curiosity for most of them.
Here are some thoughts on what I feel now, actively pursuing polymathy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
