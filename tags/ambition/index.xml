&lt;p>&lt;em>Snap-shotting projections of the mind over time is a good habit
that you should practice.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try my best to persuade you of that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An over-powered upside to pursuing multiple interests
over the span of your life is to have the ability to compare and
contrast multiple domains, akin to having multiple hill forts over
your territory than only establishing a centralized castle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reading an Author</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/reading-an-author/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 16:46:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/reading-an-author/</guid><description>&lt;p>Do note that this is an old post (from my last archived blog) that I&amp;rsquo;m

&lt;p>I, hitherto, have been reading books as a single unit of intellectual
conveyance. However, that strategy doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for all the
works. Some authors have their writings crisply intertwined with
their other writings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Approaching a single book as a part of a larger intellectual
conveyance is more efficient in the longer term if one intends to read
all the work of a particular author. Consequently, grouping these
reads together has also been somewhat interesting lately.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
