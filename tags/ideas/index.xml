into this world given the extent of novel societal tendencies that I&amp;rsquo;m
not fond of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although, the notion of Batman didn&amp;rsquo;t exist then, given a
choice, I&amp;rsquo;d probably consider time traveling to an intellectually simpler
life when much of what the present science and engineering entails was
just beginning to be discovered and invented.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Research options then weren&amp;rsquo;t thresholded by who&amp;rsquo;s packing heavier
compute but rather open to all that could observe patiently and
portrayed the will to ask, sceptic-ize and act according to their whims.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Micro-Essays</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/micro-essays/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 14:01:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/micro-essays/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to increase my frequency of writing on the main blog to get
more reps in and converge onto my style quickly than if I continued
with long form content only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m also going to practice being more concise, and blogging a little
more on technical aspects as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My usual blog post goes to around 1500-2000 words and that isn&amp;rsquo;t
helpful for covering some minor writing prompts I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Definitive Guide to Books</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/the-definitive-guide-to-books/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 03:57:29 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/the-definitive-guide-to-books/</guid><description>&lt;p>Books play a pivotal role in the life of any aspiring and existing intellectual. I began
reading diversely and seriously when I was 19 and immediately
regretted not starting sooner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading sets you up for an involved existence. If you read vastly,
you&amp;rsquo;ll be a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the span of 3 years (2019 - 2022), I read around a 100 books ranging from
the classics, biographies, auto-biographies, physics, computer science,
anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history,
how-to-books, nutrition, physiology , fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics,
business (okay, don&amp;rsquo;t judge - we all do this), economics, writing,
self help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being
funny and similar stuff), young adult (only 1 - please don&amp;rsquo;t chastise
me - I could not handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot - please don&amp;rsquo;t chastise
me) and meta books (speed reading, how to consume books, taking notes,
etc).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Creation and Publishing Pipeline</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/my-creation-and-publishing-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 18:13:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/my-creation-and-publishing-pipeline/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is an auxilliary post collating resources for the recent video I
posted &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

 &lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
 &lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKU_mNaEo1g?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video">&lt;/iframe>
 &lt;/div>

&lt;h2 id="the-pipeline">The Pipeline&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>All the ideas, resources that I want to process, any miscellaneous
questions I have, are fed into the input-queue in the buffer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All the manipulation takes place in these buffers - they&amp;rsquo;re
org-files and I use org-roam to maintain the connections&lt;/li>
&lt;li>whenever a node set ripens and is worth sharing, I write a
post or publish a video.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It can go both ways : I can force a set into maturity if I wish to
publish something specific or I may chance upon a concept when
observing connections.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="observations">Observations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I use &lt;a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui">org-roam-ui&lt;/a> to
visualize the buffer and check for linkages that might result in
something useful. I also want to publish this graph (demonstrated in
video) but there&amp;rsquo;s no explicit solution for that yet and I&amp;rsquo;m planning
to build one myself with rust and webassembly as a compilation
target.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
