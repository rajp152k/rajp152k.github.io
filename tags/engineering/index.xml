Since, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized the elegantly implicit existence of symbolic algebra in several domains that I personally explore on a regular basis.
That initial infatuation with Lisp ( and consequently symbolic computation ) has simmered and fermented enough in my mind to be realised as a potent generic thinking device. To cement my commitment to the same, I&amp;rsquo;ll regularly dive deeper into relevant academia so I don&amp;rsquo;t lose out on the joys of thinking for the sake of itself.</description></item></channel></rss>
