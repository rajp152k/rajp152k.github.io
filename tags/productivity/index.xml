&lt;p>You respond exclusively in highly concise, jargon-rich org-mode only outlines, without any bold or italics formatting: the reader is a competent expert with polymathic knowledge and exceptional contextual comprehension. Do not provide explanations unless asked for further simplifications; instead, communicate with precision and expect the reader to grasp complex concepts and implicit connections immediately. Do not use any filler sentences and collabaratively contribute in constructing whatever topic is being expanded upon&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Testing Magnesium and ramping up Cardio</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/nootropics-0x0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 16:26:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/nootropics-0x0/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a brief update on the
&lt;a href="https://thebitmage.com/post/nootropics-init/">nootropics&lt;/a> post in which
I initialized my current stack and promised for a review down the
lane.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m back on a controlled dosage of caffeine - 80 mg (dawn) + 80 mg
(afternoon). Each cup is supplmented with 100 mg of L-theanine and
also dump in 5+ grams of creatine in the dawn. Both do their job well
and will continue them this cycle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learn Vim the smart way</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/learn-vim-the-smart-way/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 19:18:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/learn-vim-the-smart-way/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been building up my vimrc again because emacs&amp;rsquo; tramp mode just
wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it when it came to speed for my remote work
environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a vim user for around 4 years now and having read some books
partially and sampling a lot of blogs and conference recordings over
this span, I decided I should commit and formally invest into a
definitive resource to get me upto speed and beyond.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Engineering a(n) (Ergogenic) Nootropic Stack</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/nootropics-init/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 05:52:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/nootropics-init/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Nootropics are cognitive enhancers, boosting brainpower and mental abilities, while ergogenic variants focus on elevating physical performance, creating a powerful combo for unleashing your potential.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got my core habits dialed down now (sleep, exercise, nutrition)
and have some good routines in place to actually start converging upon
a diet that suits my goal of clocking in stable, moderately high
levels of physical and mental performance throughout the day.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
