&lt;h2 id="gnulinux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my pipelines are based around Linux and the core GNU utils. I had to use windows for a while due to org-wide constraints but I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been given the signal to shift to linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely used any windows native tools for my workflows and there was always a layer of linux emulation/virtualization (wsl, scoop, and the likes) upon which I conducted my usual operations. Given I use Debian at home, a non native linux experience was frustrating at best and depressing at worst. No more, do I have to confine myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
