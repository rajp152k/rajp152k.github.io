The Pipeline All the ideas, resources that I want to process, any miscellaneous questions I have, are fed into the input-queue in the buffer All the manipulation takes place in these buffers - they&amp;rsquo;re org-files and I use org-roam to maintain the connections whenever a node set ripens and is worth sharing, I write a post or publish a video.</description></item><item><title>Common Lisp : The Series - 0 : Introduction</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/clts/clts-0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 12:03:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/clts/clts-0/</guid><description>This is the first in a series of blog posts that follow the educational common lisp series on my youtube channel as an auxilliary.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be summarizing the videos in these blogs and be using these to point to references and additional resources that further elaborate the matter.
This post is about why you should consider learning common lisp and how I intend to execute the plan of building an end to end resource index while simultaneously being able to learn more about the language myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
