diverse domain. It&amp;rsquo;d been more a year since I graduated (majored in
computer science and minored in artificial intelligence) and so I
decided to brush up on some basics and consolidate what I&amp;rsquo;d studying
since the past ~4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also picked up the book to systematically populate my org-roam
buffer and have my root node rooted &lt;a href="https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20230911114632-the100pagemlbook.html"&gt;here in the
braindump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Practical Natural Language Processing : Chapters 1-5</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/practical-nlp-c1-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 16:32:06 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/practical-nlp-c1-5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I took this up when I had to setup a bunch of NLP pipelines for work and
this does stand true to its name - it is a quick and practical index
into approaches, introductory theory and useful libraries for the
same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like reading text books at a stretch due to several reasons:-
&amp;ldquo;cross a bridge, when you get to it&amp;rdquo; is something that has stood the
test of time for me when it comes to reading practical books. I don&amp;rsquo;t
find it useful to read stuff without the doing if that is what the
book is intended for.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Common Lisp - A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/cl-aitsc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 17:51:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/cl-aitsc/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Given I&amp;rsquo;ve passed through SICP once, quickly grasping common
lisp to build stuff and explore the
traditional and industrial aspects of lisp (I know clojure exists but
traditional&amp;hellip;) was my next objective: with decent speed and only
solving the somewhat involved exercises, it took me two weeks to
complete this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a challenge but to adapt to the
environment and the topics introduced. The book does not explore
concepts with depth (CLOS, macros, etc&amp;hellip;) but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the
objective of an introduction anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
