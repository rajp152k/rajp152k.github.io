It&amp;rsquo;d been more a year since I graduated (majored in computer science and minored in artificial intelligence) and so I decided to brush up on some basics and consolidate what I&amp;rsquo;d studying since the past ~4 years.
I also picked up the book to systematically populate my org-roam buffer and have my root node rooted here in the braindump.</description></item><item><title>Practical Natural Language Processing : Chapters 1-5</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/practical-nlp-c1-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 16:32:06 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/practical-nlp-c1-5/</guid><description>I took this up when I had to setup a bunch of NLP pipelines for work and this does stand true to its name - it is a quick and practical index into approaches, introductory theory and useful libraries for the same.
I don&amp;rsquo;t like reading text books at a stretch due to several reasons:- &amp;ldquo;cross a bridge, when you get to it&amp;rdquo; is something that has stood the test of time for me when it comes to reading practical books.</description></item><item><title>Common Lisp - A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/cl-aitsc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 17:51:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/cl-aitsc/</guid><description>Given I&amp;rsquo;ve passed through SICP once, quickly grasping common lisp to build stuff and explore the traditional and industrial aspects of lisp (I know clojure exists but traditional&amp;hellip;) was my next objective: with decent speed and only solving the somewhat involved exercises, it took me two weeks to complete this book.
The exercises aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a challenge but to adapt to the environment and the topics introduced. The book does not explore concepts with depth (CLOS, macros, etc&amp;hellip;) but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the objective of an introduction anyway.</description></item></channel></rss>
