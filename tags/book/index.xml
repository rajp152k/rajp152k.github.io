The exercises aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a challenge but to adapt to the environment and the concepts introduced. The book does not explore concepts with depth (CLOS, macros, etc&amp;hellip;) but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the objective of an introduction anyway.</description></item></channel></rss>
