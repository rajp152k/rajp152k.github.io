&lt;p>I intend to formalize my plans of getting good at multiple domains not
for the reputation that follows but for the generic insight about the
world that you may harness as a result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the second refactor of the way I approach this subject and
this time around I will be pushing for practical indicators that allow
me to gauge my progress over time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Teh worth of a workd</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/free-writing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 10:21:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/free-writing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Writing is an involved process. A rough overview is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you think of an idea&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you build upon that idea with what you already know&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you structure out some initial drafts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you run it under a careful eye to scrape out the loopholes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you edit it, to the point of satisfaction&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The problem with that process is the last bullet right there. It makes
the worth of a word in the moment diminish than the act of etching
something down in stone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Most News is Noise</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/news-noise/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 20:37:42 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/news-noise/</guid><description>&lt;p>I find most sources of information these days (since several years) to
be too noisy compared to the actual signals of wisdom you expect from
a popular source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rarely, I&amp;rsquo;ll pull up the news application on my phone and consume a
whole bunch of generic, and some domain specific news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than state of the art research in a technical domain, which is
based upon a corpora of established citations, most other &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; stuff is
noise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Converging Expression - thought, speech and the word writ</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/conciser/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 17:26:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/conciser/</guid><description>&lt;p>Speech and the word written, are potential expressions of a
thought. Each one of us enjoys a different mix of how we best convey
ourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ever since I began blogging when I was 19, I&amp;rsquo;ve been prioritising
descriptiveness over precision. I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve entered a
mental state where I value the distilled value of the transmission
more than the exhaustiveness of the message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also notice a rift between the way I speak and the way I write. Not
to say that any one of them is superior than the other but I could use
an exercise in convergence - projecting them both onto a common
ground.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understand Reality and Imparting Meaning</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/understand-v-impart/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 17:39:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/understand-v-impart/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been formally delving into epistemology and relevant lateral root
domains recently and have been re-encountering several ideas that I&amp;rsquo;d
previously casually explored with intrinsic motivation.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t my first accidental implicit intersection of thoughts with
core philosophical theories like constructivist epistemology and
ontology.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given my natural inclinations towards personal interdisciplinary
research, apart from my core specializations, I do deliberately maintain an
extensive scaffolding around several domains that I plan to build
foundations in soon. This allows me to generalize over multiple
realizations of similar concepts in different epistemological clusters
and identify some interesting patterns.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hunt, Feast, Repeat</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/hunt-feast-repeat/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 09:05:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/hunt-feast-repeat/</guid><description>&lt;p>I partition my days in phases of different mindsets that allow me to
cater to my varying epistemological hungers. One of them is a daily
ninety minute ideation hunt and feast that helps keep my skills sharp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The laws of thermodynamics do form a formidable devil that really does
mess up your ordered habits if you do not inject in the necessary
energy from time to time.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a way to sharpen the intellectual axe, I envision
myself going on domain hunts to allot myself a new class of game to
look forward to during minor breaks from my usual, comparatively
conventional endeavors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learn Vim the smart way</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/learn-vim-the-smart-way/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 19:18:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/learn-vim-the-smart-way/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been building up my vimrc again because emacs&amp;rsquo; tramp mode just
wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it when it came to speed for my remote work
environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a vim user for around 4 years now and having read some books
partially and sampling a lot of blogs and conference recordings over
this span, I decided I should commit and formally invest into a
definitive resource to get me upto speed and beyond.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Micro-Essays</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/micro-essays/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2023 14:01:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/micro-essays/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to increase my frequency of writing on the main blog to get
more reps in and converge onto my style quickly than if I continued
with long form content only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m also going to practice being more concise, and blogging a little
more on technical aspects as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My usual blog post goes to around 1500-2000 words and that isn&amp;rsquo;t
helpful for covering some minor writing prompts I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
