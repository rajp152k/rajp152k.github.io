&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve began to grasp why they actually might be a necessary construct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when leading larger societal initiatives, simply claiming ethical superiority doesn&amp;rsquo;t pan out well (and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t) with the need to gain the trust of masses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need displays of competence for people to will their incentives to align with yours somehow (necessary for collective progress).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;claiming dignity is simply not enough and that is a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;of course, this opens up a whole bunch of societal games and dynamics that are too complicated for me to completely break down right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do wish to make a change, you will someday have to take the helm of larger groups of humans. This is when being competent and having proofs for it becomes indispensible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
