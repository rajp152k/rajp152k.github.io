&lt;p>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve began to grasp why they actually might be a necessary construct:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>when leading larger societal initiatives, simply claiming ethical superiority doesn&amp;rsquo;t pan out well (and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t) with the need to gain the trust of masses.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you need displays of competence for people to will their incentives to align with yours somehow (necessary for collective progress).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>claiming dignity is simply not enough and that is a good thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>of course, this opens up a whole bunch of societal games and dynamics that are too complicated for me to completely break down right now.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you do wish to make a change, you will someday have to take the helm of larger groups of humans. This is when being competent and having proofs for it becomes indispensible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quick Musings</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/quickies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 20:24:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/quickies/</guid><description>&lt;p>From time to time, I do encounter ideas that intrigue my intellect for quite some time.&lt;br>
I do maintain the &lt;a href="https://buffer.thebitmage.com">ideation buffer&lt;/a> to index these ideas into the larger context of my past musings, but I would also like a conveniently accessible chronological search available for cross-domain ideas.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;ll hence be increasing the frequency of premature technical thoughts being packaged into a micro-blogs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I might not elaborate a whole lot in terms of the theoretical aspects of the tooling but I&amp;rsquo;ll be conceptually outlining my current thoughts over the same.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
