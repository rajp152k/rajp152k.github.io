&lt;p>All of us create content, every moment, tuned to varying extents of influence and
permanence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s intent that separates us all into different leagues of
producers.&lt;br>
Let me explain via a hierarchical build up of selected formats of content with
varying intensity.&lt;br>
Note that the list isn&amp;rsquo;t exhaustive by any means and I&amp;rsquo;ve deliberately
excluded works of larger scale (movies, video games : they have the
potential to be the most influential kind of content out there).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prompt Crafting Distilled</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/dense-guide-prompt-engineering/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 16:38:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/dense-guide-prompt-engineering/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-premise">The Premise&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I was initially reluctant on using generative AI for my writing
process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I was quite aware of the potential of large language
models (generically addressed as LLMs in here henceforth) -
especially true in the case of content creators and/or eccentrically
curious individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I, therefore, decided to clarify how I&amp;rsquo;ll be using generative AI for
my ideation process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-promise">The Promise&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before we get onto that, as promised by the title, distilling the
over-arching skills needed to extract good insights from a
conversation with an LLM (an el-el-em; please don&amp;rsquo;t read it as large, please..).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
