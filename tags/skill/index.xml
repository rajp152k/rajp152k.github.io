&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a generalist at all times during your journey into polymathy. I mentally grasped this fairly recently that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to shun specializing for smaller durations.
Something like a day is obvious as a candidate but, in the past, I would shy away from even periods of a month to actually focus on a singular thing. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly comfortable doing that for upto three months now but would recommend touching a large span of domains over the span of six months for you don&amp;rsquo;t want to start losing out on the humility that interdisciplinary pursuits enforce on you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
