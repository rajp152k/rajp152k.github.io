been considering how I approach the whole thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of talking about what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking in the moment (pretty
fleeting), I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is exactly the point where I&amp;rsquo;ll go &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m planning on &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; : I do
not wish like doing that anymore. Talking about my momentary plans for
a while has been quite the distraction that I occasionally enjoy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Definitive Guide to Books</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/the-definitive-guide-to-books/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 03:57:29 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/the-definitive-guide-to-books/</guid><description>&lt;p>Books play a pivotal role in the life of any aspiring and existing intellectual. I began
reading diversely and seriously when I was 19 and immediately
regretted not starting sooner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading sets you up for an involved existence. If you read vastly,
you&amp;rsquo;ll be a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the span of 3 years (2019 - 2022), I read around a 100 books ranging from
the classics, biographies, auto-biographies, physics, computer science,
anthropology, data science, etymology, theology, game theory, mathematics, history,
how-to-books, nutrition, physiology , fitness, health, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics,
business (okay, don&amp;rsquo;t judge - we all do this), economics, writing,
self help (guilty as charged), spirituality, humor (guides to being
funny and similar stuff), young adult (only 1 - please don&amp;rsquo;t chastise
me - I could not handle the cringe), philosophy (a lot - please don&amp;rsquo;t chastise
me) and meta books (speed reading, how to consume books, taking notes,
etc).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Here we go again...</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/writing-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 20:12:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/writing-setup/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;h2 id="a-brief-history">A Brief History&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I took up writing as a hobby in the sophomore year of my bachelors and
it turned out to be the most definitive step towards bettering my way
with words and expressing myself accurately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the fourth major iteration on my blogging system and I&amp;rsquo;ve
noticed that I&amp;rsquo;m slowly tending towards minimalism and an overall
clutter-free approach with each step, building up from my past
stylistic mistakes and experiences. As with any beginner, I began with
enthusiasm and held my ideas in high regard - a major reason for why I
felt they should be out there. Over time, as I read more, I
learned I had a lot more to learn and finally after a long break of
writing frequently, here I am again, at symbolic ground zero -
drafting a first post.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
