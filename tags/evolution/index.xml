&lt;p>Thinking about compiling more such landmarks &amp;ndash; an itinerary for fellow cyber pilgrims&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reviewing older codebases is an underrated exercise for software engineers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a journey through the evolution of code, revealing the engineering decisions that moulded what we deal with today&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tracing the history of a project – understanding what worked, what didn&amp;rsquo;t, and how technical components evolved – has been a joy lately&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solitude, Society, Originality</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/solitude-society-originality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 21:49:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/solitude-society-originality/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some-days, I wonder that I&amp;rsquo;m born half a millennia too late
into this world given the extent of novel societal tendencies that I&amp;rsquo;m
not fond of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although, the notion of Batman didn&amp;rsquo;t exist then, given a
choice, I&amp;rsquo;d probably consider time traveling to an intellectually simpler
life when much of what the present science and engineering entails was
just beginning to be discovered and invented.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Research options then weren&amp;rsquo;t thresholded by who&amp;rsquo;s packing heavier
compute but rather open to all that could observe patiently and
portrayed the will to ask, sceptic-ize and act according to their whims.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
