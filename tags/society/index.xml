&lt;p&gt;Not so much because you lack self control (that&amp;rsquo;s the easy part and have that figured out) but more because all the relatives are out there stuffing delicacies down your throat at all times through a whole bunch of ceremonies (I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough fingers to keep up with the count).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>On Achievements</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/achievements/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 06:12:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/achievements/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have a somewhat indifferent approach towards achievements(mine and others&amp;rsquo;): with tendencies to gauge the personalities based on how their conversations flow and in terms of the quality of the questions and problems they are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve began to grasp why they actually might be a necessary construct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when leading larger societal initiatives, simply claiming ethical superiority doesn&amp;rsquo;t pan out well (and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t) with the need to gain the trust of masses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need displays of competence for people to will their incentives to align with yours somehow (necessary for collective progress).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;claiming dignity is simply not enough and that is a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;of course, this opens up a whole bunch of societal games and dynamics that are too complicated for me to completely break down right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do wish to make a change, you will someday have to take the helm of larger groups of humans. This is when being competent and having proofs for it becomes indispensible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I turned 0x2222 today</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/0x2222/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 19:09:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/0x2222/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, I prefer tracking the temporal increments of my existence
(&amp;ldquo;age&amp;rdquo; is what normal humans would say this means) via &lt;a href="https://buffer.thebitmage.com/20230712132109-timestamps.html#ID-20230712T132110.496747"&gt;hex
timestamps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I kept track of my age in years and months like
normal humans do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain the habit of analysing my mindset every major temporal
mileston in my life - when I turned 10 (I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember
exactly how I felt then) or 20, for instance, in accordance with the
widely accepted gregorian calendar.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
