&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d always wanted to write production lisp: was dreaming about it since sophomore year of uni (~7 years to that): finally.., we&amp;rsquo;re here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going to start work on &lt;a href="https://github.com/nilenso/goose"&gt;goose&lt;/a&gt; : along the way, chasing that lisp flow/enlightenment I once experienced long ago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post discussions with some folks, clojure isn&amp;rsquo;t supposed the vanilla lisp and aspects orthogonal to that mindset await to be grasped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;going for a focused burst of immersion (practical coupled with a literature sweep (blogs, papers, books)) to really get a feel for what&amp;rsquo;s up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have been going easy for the past couple of years when it comes to levelling up on my lisp speak because there was always some work I had to get done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interesting that this is work now, long way..&lt;/li&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;ll soon be incorporating them into posts here. I had a habit of
writing in streams in the main blog itself and there is a lot of
insight stored in the chronology of some such logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old blog is archived in the repository
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rajp152k/19-22_archive"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I could benefit
from repurposing old works into the present setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll mainly be focusing on editing the fluff out, finding what good
stylistic knacks I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated over the years, and rejecting the
questionable habits that don&amp;rsquo;t serve me so well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
