I&amp;rsquo;ll soon be incorporating them into posts here. I had a habit of
writing in streams in the main blog itself and there is a lot of
insight stored in the chronology of some such logs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The old blog is archived in the repository
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rajp152k/19-22_archive">here&lt;/a> and I could benefit
from repurposing old works into the present setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll mainly be focusing on editing the fluff out, finding what good
stylistic knacks I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated over the years, and rejecting the
questionable habits that don&amp;rsquo;t serve me so well.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
