The science that happens today in institutions is more than just science and involves a lot of ancillary efforts directed towards the formalized production of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I respect formalized scientific efforts but feel like humanity as whole is losing out on the idea of having personalized problem statements to work on without worrying about applications, citations or what the next big thing is going to be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Most News is Noise</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/news-noise/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 20:37:42 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/news-noise/</guid><description>&lt;p>I find most sources of information these days (since several years) to
be too noisy compared to the actual signals of wisdom you expect from
a popular source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rarely, I&amp;rsquo;ll pull up the news application on my phone and consume a
whole bunch of generic, and some domain specific news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than state of the art research in a technical domain, which is
based upon a corpora of established citations, most other &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; stuff is
noise.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
