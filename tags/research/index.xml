While I enjoy the pragmatism of the former, I also wish to build up my innate curiosity to get under the hood, disassemble the engine and be able to put it back together: no project (except the explicit choice of doing so) is going to help me fit that in my studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consequently, I&amp;rsquo;m planning on getting started with a regulary habit of exploring domains with depth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The PaperShelf</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/citeread/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 17:38:16 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/citeread/</guid><description>&lt;p>From time to time, I like to make minor tweaks to my blog based on the treasure trinkets I find around in different corners of the internet from blogs/works of personalities I follow/find interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got into the practice of logging updates in reverse chronological streams from one of my professors in my sophomore year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I began personalized hex timestamps (today is 0x2360 for me) because I don&amp;rsquo;t intuitively gel well with the (Julian -&amp;gt; Gregorian) cycles. The combination of lunar, solar and planetary cycles is my most recent experimental initiative for calibrating long term efforts but that would be a little too chaotic for the part of the world wide web that I mostly interact with these days.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Personalized Science</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/personal-research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 11:14:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/personal-research/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like studying and exploring new things in the spirit of science. The science that happens today in institutions is more than just science and involves a lot of ancillary efforts directed towards the formalized production of research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I respect formalized scientific efforts but feel like humanity as whole is losing out on the idea of having personalized problem statements to work on without worrying about applications, citations or what the next big thing is going to be.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Most News is Noise</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/news-noise/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 20:37:42 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/news-noise/</guid><description>&lt;p>I find most sources of information these days (since several years) to
be too noisy compared to the actual signals of wisdom you expect from
a popular source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rarely, I&amp;rsquo;ll pull up the news application on my phone and consume a
whole bunch of generic, and some domain specific news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other than state of the art research in a technical domain, which is
based upon a corpora of established citations, most other &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; stuff is
noise.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
