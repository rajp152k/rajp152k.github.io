&lt;p>I was initially reluctant on using generative AI for my writing
process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That being said, I was quite aware of the potential of large language
models (generically addressed as LLMs in here henceforth) -
especially true in the case of content creators and/or eccentrically
curious individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I, therefore, decided to clarify how I&amp;rsquo;ll be using generative AI for
my ideation process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-promise">The Promise&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before we get onto that, as promised by the title, distilling the
over-arching skills needed to extract good insights from a
conversation with an LLM (an el-el-em; please don&amp;rsquo;t read it as large, please..).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I have a Writing Tutor now ...</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/better-writer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:30:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/better-writer/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a &lt;a href="https://buffer.thebitmage.com/sitemap?stack=%2F20230920144401-prompt_engineering.html">book on prompt engineering&lt;/a> and decided to
practice a little&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a conversation I had with chatGPT regarding a small essay I
wrote recently and fortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s room to improve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Raj: You are my writing critic for this session; do not make any intellectual changes in any text I paste; do not heavily influence my style; only analyze what I say and generate pointers as to how I can become a better writer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PICC: pragmatics of intellectual consumption and creation</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/picc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2023 10:40:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/picc/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>Managing one&amp;rsquo;s intellectual appetite in these times of information
(and noise) excess is quite an ordeal. Given superior
tooling and methods to plough through dense
knowledge forests, coming up with the right set of tools for
oneself is still a commendable task. In this post, I sketch out
how one could go about making such choices practically, from why you
should bother, to what tangible actions you can get started with.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
