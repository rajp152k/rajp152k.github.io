&lt;p>I, hitherto, have been reading books as a single unit of intellectual
conveyance. However, that strategy doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for all the
works. Some authors have their writings crisply intertwined with
their other writings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Approaching a single book as a part of a larger intellectual
conveyance is more efficient in the longer term if one intends to read
all the work of a particular author. Consequently, grouping these
reads together has also been somewhat interesting lately.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
