I&amp;rsquo;m back on a controlled dosage of caffeine - 80 mg (dawn) + 80 mg (afternoon). Each cup is supplmented with 100 mg of L-theanine and also dump in 5+ grams of creatine in the dawn. Both do their job well and will continue them this cycle.</description></item><item><title>Engineering a(n) (Ergogenic) Nootropic Stack</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/nootropics-init/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2023 05:52:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/nootropics-init/</guid><description>Nootropics are cognitive enhancers, boosting brainpower and mental abilities, while ergogenic variants focus on elevating physical performance, creating a powerful combo for unleashing your potential.
