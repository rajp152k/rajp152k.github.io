thought. Each one of us enjoys a different mix of how we best convey
ourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ever since I began blogging when I was 19, I&amp;rsquo;ve been prioritising
descriptiveness over precision. I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve entered a
mental state where I value the distilled value of the transmission
more than the exhaustiveness of the message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also notice a rift between the way I speak and the way I write. Not
to say that any one of them is superior than the other but I could use
an exercise in convergence - projecting them both onto a common
ground.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
