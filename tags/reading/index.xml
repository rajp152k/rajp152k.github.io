&lt;p&gt;I got into the practice of logging updates in reverse chronological streams from one of my professors in my sophomore year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began personalized hex timestamps (today is 0x2360 for me) because I don&amp;rsquo;t intuitively gel well with the (Julian -&amp;gt; Gregorian) cycles. The combination of lunar, solar and planetary cycles is my most recent experimental initiative for calibrating long term efforts but that would be a little too chaotic for the part of the world wide web that I mostly interact with these days.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IKN0X224C: Epistemological Polyglotism</title><link>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/ikn0x/ikn0x224c/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 20:29:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajp152k.github.io/post/ikn0x/ikn0x224c/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;check out what an IKN0x means &lt;a href="https://thebitmage.com/post/ikn0x0/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding different languages can open up one&amp;rsquo;s mind towards
different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of languages over centuries and common ancestors
there-of over millenia indicates the evolution of cultural
complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-conventional-take"&gt;The Conventional Take&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up actively conversing in 4 languages: English, Hindi,
Marathi and Gujrati. French was my first romance language I was
exposed to for over 8 years (I say exposed as was learning this
academically as a third language and didn&amp;rsquo;t use this as a &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;
language as much as the others).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
