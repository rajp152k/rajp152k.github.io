- an unrooted snapdragon ARM Android with Termux and Tmux for ephemeral vimmin &amp;amp; sshing around when on the move&lt;br>
- an Intel x86 FreeBSD home lab for some asynchronous compute that I don&amp;rsquo;t need right away and some redundancy for my important files&lt;br>
- a personal ubuntu VPS with a couple of intel x86 vCPUs for my self hosting endeavours and overall context orchestration&lt;br>
- several compute clusters (avx enabled x86s, ARM, &amp;ldquo;the propietary GPU driver guy on the street&amp;rdquo; GPUs, &amp;ldquo;the other open source GPU driver guy on the steet&amp;rdquo; GPUs, k8s orchestrated production &amp;amp; development playgrounds) for work&lt;br>

&lt;h2 id="gnulinux">GNU/Linux&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All of my pipelines are based around Linux and the core GNU utils. I had to use windows for a while due to org-wide constraints but I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been given the signal to shift to linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I rarely used any windows native tools for my workflows and there was always a layer of linux emulation/virtualization (wsl, scoop, and the likes) upon which I conducted my usual operations. Given I use Debian at home, a non native linux experience was frustrating at best and depressing at worst. No more, do I have to confine myself.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
